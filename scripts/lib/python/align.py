"""This module provides several methods for doing string alignment.

All of these methods take two iterables (can be either lists or strings) as
arguments.  The first iterable (L1) represents string or list to which
alignment should be done, another iterable (L2) represents string or list which
should be aligned.  Optionally, penalties for different types of modifications
(insertion, deletion, substitution) can be specified either as positional or as
keyword arguments.  These arguments should be functions which accept one (for
insertion or deletion) or two (for substitution) characters (or any list
elements) as arguments and return corresponding penalty scores for
modifications.  The output is another list which has length equal to the length
of L1, where each element is a list of indices of L2 corresponding to given L1
elements.

1) Example:

        nw_align("AGTACGCA", "TCGC")
        => [[], [], [0], [], [1], [2], [3], []]

  this corresponds to the alignment
  AGTACGCA
    T CGC

Please note that the alignment function is not commutative, it means that
`nw_align("AGTACGCA", "TCGC")` is not equal to `nw_align("TCGC", "AGTACGCA")`.
Just to show that, here is the output of the latter call:

        => [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [6, 7]]

Please also note that different algorithms may give different alignments for
tie cases.

Methods:
hb_align - Hirschberg alignment algorithm: (O(nm) time; O(min{n, m}) space)
nw_align - Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm: (O(nm) time; O(nm) space)
