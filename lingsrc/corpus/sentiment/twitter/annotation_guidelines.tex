\section{Introduction}
Welcome. In this assignment your task is to annotate sentiments in a
corpus of Twitter messages.

\subsection{Annotation Tool}

For annotation you will use \texttt{MMAX2} - a freely available
annotation tool which you can download under following link:

\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmax2/files/mmax2/mmax2_1.13.003/MMAX2_1.13.003b.zip/download}

After you have downloaded and unpacked the archive file, a directory
called \texttt{1.13.003} will appear in your download folder. If you
have never used \texttt{MMAX2} before, please read chapters 1 through
5 of document mmax2quickstart.pdf which you can find in subdirectory
\texttt{1.13.003/Docs}. After you have read this document, please
change in your terminal to the subfolder \texttt{1.13.003/MMAX2} of
the unpacked archive and type the commands\\ \texttt{chmod u+x
  ./mmax2.sh}\\ \texttt{nohup ./mmax2.sh \&}\\ to start
\texttt{MMAX2}. Upon doing this an \texttt{MMAX2} window should appear
on your desktop.

\subsection{Corpus Files}

You should also have received a copy of \texttt{MMAX2} project files
with corpus data as a tar-gzipped archive. Unpack this archive using
command\\\texttt{tar -xzf twitter-sentiment.tgz}\\After that, a
directory called \texttt{mmax-prj} should appear in your current
folder. After that, change to your \texttt{MMAX2} window and click on
the menu \texttt{File -> Load}. In the appeared popup menu, select a
path to the unpacked \texttt{mmax-prj} folder and choose one of the
\texttt{*.mmax} files there, say \texttt{general.1.mmax}. Source data
will be loaded into \texttt{MMAX2} program.

\section{Tags and Attributes}
In this annotation we will use following tags with following
attributes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\xmltag{sentiment}}
\texttt{\xmltag{sentiment}}s are our most important markables.  For
the purpose of this assignment we will only regard as sentiments
statetements which express some polar attitudes of a writer or a
speaker with regard to some objects, activities or events. We WILL NOT
count as sentiments vague emotional states of an author which are not
related to any particular subject nor will we regard as sentiments
expressions of uncertainty or communicative acts like apologies or
commands, though one can find such definition in the literature. As a
rule of thumb for annotating sentiments you should always act as
follows: first ask yourself whether a sentence you are looking at is
neutral or expresses some polar attitude, in case it has some polar
attitude, ask yourself whether this polar opinion is distinctly
targeted at some thing or event which is visible or assumable from
context and only if it does - mark relevant span with sentiment tag.

\texttt{\xmltag{sentiment}}s encompass spans of text which express
polar opinion about some distinctly visible or at least assumable
targets. These spans should only comprise information pertaining to
the attitude and whenever possible should not include any independent
irrelevant information. Such spans are usually expressed as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item single noune phrases (e.g. \textit{eine herrliche Blume} -
    \textit{a wonderful flower});
  \item single clause (e.g. \textit{Ich mag diese Fernsehshow} -
    \textit{I like this TV show});
  \item multiple clauses (e.g. \textit{Diese Regierung is die beste
    aller Zeiten. April, April!} - \textit{This government is the best
    ever. April fool!}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples}
Things you SHOULD mark as sentiments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Noun phrases and statements expressing polar opinions
    (e.g. \textit{Der neue Film \"uber Superman war knorke!} -
    \textit{The new superman movie was fantastic});
  \item Interrogative clauses in case they express some polar opinion
    and don't call this opinion into question but rather ask for its
    reasons or other related aspects (e.g. \textit{Warum findet die
      Mehrheit der Bev\"olkerung CDU so toll?} - \textit{Why does the
      majority of population consider CDU great?});
  \item Exclamations in case they express support or disapproval of
    something (e.g. \textit{Der Sommer ist da. Super!} -
    \textit{Summer has come. Great!}).
  \item Comparisons\footnote{Comparison sentiments are marked
    specially -- see attribute \textit{polarity} of \textit{sentiment}
    tags and attributes \textit{preferred}/\textit{dispreferred} of
    markables \textit{target}.} in case they express some preference
    of one object with reard to another (e.g. \textit{Canon EOS 550d
      macht bessere Aufnahmen als 600d} - \textit{Canon EOS 550d takes
      better pictures than 600d}).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Counter-Examples}
Things you SHOULD NOT mark as sentiments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statements describing some emotional states for which no
    target can be derived or found (e.g. \textit{Ich f\"uhle mich so
      traurig :(} - \textit{Feeling so blue :(});
  \item Statements describing some objective facts, even if possible
    consequences of these facts can be assumed to have negative
    influence on the author (e.g. \textit{Wenn ein Floh einen Menschen
      bei\ss{}t und ihn mit erbrochenem Blut infiziert, werden die
      Pestbakterien ins Gewebe \"ubertragen.} - \textit{When a flea
      bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated
      blood, the plague carrying bacteria are passed into the
      tissue.});
  \item Interrogative clauses in case they ask whether some polar
    opinion is true or not. (e.g. \textit{Findet die Mehrheit
      der Bev\"olkerung CDU toll?} - \textit{Does the majority
      of population consider CDU great?});
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\xmltag{sentiment} tags have following attributes with following
values:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.6\textwidth}|}\hline
  Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \multirow{3}{*}{polarity} & \textit{positive} & this sentiment
  expresses positive attitude to its respective target\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{negative\newline(default)} & this sentiment
  expresses negative attitude to its respective target\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{comparison} & this sentiment expresses comparison of two
  things with preference given to some of them\\\hline
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \multirow{2}{*}{sarcasm} & \textit{true} & this polar attitutde is
  meant as a derision, i.e. its actual polarity is the opposite of its
  apparent form (that means that an apparent praise is in fact meant
  as rebuke and vice versa - but this actual sense can only be
  derieved on the basis of outside context or )\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{false\newline(default)} & no sarcasm present - polar
  attitude has literal meaning\\\hline
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \multirow{3}{*}{intensity} & \textit{0} & stylictically weakly
  marked expression which tends more towards a neutral
  sentence\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{1\newline(default)} & middle stylistic
  expressivity\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{2} & stylistically very expressive sentiment\\\hline
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & in case a
  single sentiment is not a contiguous text span but rather split into
  parts, you can draw an edge with this label from additional parts of
  a sentiment to its main part\\\hline
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\xmltag{source}}
With \texttt{\xmltag{source}} tag you should mark original author(s)
of respective sentiment opinions. For example, in sentence \textit{Sie
  mag Ihren neuen Outfit nicht} (\textit{She doesn't likes her new
  outfit}) - ``Sie'' (``She'') should be considered as opinon's origin
i.e. \textit{source} of sentiment relation.

Source tags should encompass spans denoting the author, which will
usually be expressed by pronouns, nouns or multiword expressions,
e.g. \textit{Neue Z\"uricher Zeitung}. Please, mark complete noun
phrases denoting the authors, i.e. nouns with all their respective
dependent attributes.

\subsubsection{Examples}
Things you SHOULD mark as sources:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Original author(s) of polar opinions, i.e. those persons,
    groups or officials who experience sympathy or aversion for
    something e.g. \textit{\textbf{Michael} meinte, das w\"are die
      beste L\"osung.}  (\textit{\textbf{Michael} thought, it was the
      best solution.});
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Counter-Examples}
Things you SHOULD NOT mark as sources:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Persons how are neutrally citing someone else's opinion,
    e.g. in the sentence \textit{Nach Tatjanas Worten war Michael sehr
      dar\"uber ver\"argert.} (\textit{According to Tatjana, Michael
      was very angry about that.}) you should only mark
    \textit{Michael} as sentiment's source and should not mark
    \textit{Tatjana}. Please note, that in case when an author
    supports or contradicts to someone else's opinion, two sentiment
    relations should be made - one with the original author as source,
    and one with the supporter/opponent of the opinion enclosed in
    source tags.\footnote{In that case sentiments will overlap, and
      you also should mark these sources with \textit{sentiment-ref}-tag.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}\label{src-attrs}
\textit{source} tags have only two attributes which both are directed
edges. The first attribute called \textit{sentiment-ref} should point
from \textit{source} elements to \textit{sentiment} span which this
source belongs to in cases when:
\begin{inparaenum}
\item multiple sentiment relations overlap with each other,
\item source element is outside the sentiment relation but is within
  visible context.
\end{inparaenum}
The second attribute - \textit{anaphref} - should only be applied in
cases when source element is expressed by pronoun or pronominal adverb
and antecedents of them are visble within local context . In that
case, \textit{anaphref} edge should point from pronoun/pronominal
adverb to the respective antecedent.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.6\textwidth}|}\hline
  Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & directed edge
  pointing from an outside source element to its respective sentiment,
  or in case of multiple overlapping sentiments when one source
  element is included in both of sentiment element - in that case this
  edge should point from source to its respective sentiment span\\\hline

  anaphref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & directed edge
  pointing from source element expressed by pronoun or pronominal
  adverb to their respective antecedents\\\hline
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\xmltag{target}}
As \texttt{\xmltag{target}} element you should mark persons, things,
events or actions which the opinion is made about.

Coordinatively connected noun phrases both of which represent targets
should be marked separately. In cases when sentiment is a comparison,
you should also mark two separate targets. One target should comprise
object which is preferred in comparison, another one should encompass
disprefered object. You should also set corresponding
\textit{preference} attributes in respective \xmltag{target} tags.

Targets are usually expressed by noun phrases or clauses. You are
asked to mark complete noun phrases (that means nouns and all their
respective attributes). Clauses should also be marked completely.

\subsubsection{Examples}
Elements you SHOULD mark as targets:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Persons, things or objects which the opinion is made about,
    e.g. \textit{Ich hasse \textbf{lange Schlangen}} (\textit{I hate
      \textbf{long queues}});

  \item Descriptions of actions or events, e.g. \textit{Ich hasse es,
    \textbf{wenn St\'arkere Schw\"achere drangsalieren}} (\textit{I
    hate it \textbf{when stronger people ride weaker ones}});

  \item Compared elements of a comparison,
    e.g. \textit{\textbf{\"Altere Handys} halten l\"anger als
      \textbf{moderne Smartphones}} (\textit{\textbf{Older mobile
        phones} longer hold charge than \textbf{modern smartphones}}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\textit{target} attributes fully correspond to the attributes of
\textit{source} elements. So refer to section \ref{src-attrs} for
description of possible attributes for targets.

\subsection{\xmltag{emo-expression}}
\texttt{\xmltag{emo-expression}}s are lexical elements which bear some
polarity meaning on their own, that usually are words like
\textit{gut} (\textit{good}), \textit{schlechter} (\textit{worse}),
\textit{m\"ogen} (\textit{like}), or \textit{hassen}
(\textit{hate}). Such elements can be expressed either as single words
or as complex expressions (in case of idiomatic expressions or support
verbs, for example).

\subsubsection{Examples}
Elements you SHOULD mark as emo-expressions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Adjectives and adverbs bearing polar attitudes \textit{Peter
    hatte \textbf{bessere} Noten in der Schule als sein Bruder}
    (\textit{Peter had \textbf{better} grades at school than his
    brother.});

  \item Verbs expressing attitude of a speaker to target,
    e.g. \textit{Mir \textbf{gefiel} die neue House-Staffel}
    (\textit{I \textbf{liked} the new House series});

  \item Idiomatic expression including support verbs
    e.g. \textit{\textbf{Zum Teufel} soll die neue Regierung
      \textbf{gehen}} (\textit{The new government should \textbf{go to
        the Deuce}}).

  \item Smileys in case they really express an emotional attitude and
    are not used for politeness or without any particular meaning
    e.g. \textit{Gleich in Braunschweig mit Kameraden treffen
        \textbf{:)}} (\textit{Will soon meet friends in Braunschweig
        \textbf{:)}}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\xmltag{sentiment} tags have following attributes with following
values:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.6\textwidth}|}\hline
  Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \multirow{2}{*}{polarity} & \textit{positive} & this emotional
  expression has positive polar meaning about sentiment's
  target\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{negative\newline(default)} & this emotional expression has
  negative polar meaning\\\hline

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \multirow{3}{*}{intensity} & \textit{0} & stylictically weakly
  marked emotional expression\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{1\newline(default)} & middle stylistic
  expressivity\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{2} & stylistically very expressive emotional
  expression\\\hline

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  emo-expression-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & in cases
  when a single emotional expression is not represented as a
  contiguous span but rather split into separate parts, this edge
  should point from parts to the main part of emo-expression (choose
  whatever part you want as main an connect all the other parts to it
  - it does not matter which part you'll consider as main)\\\hline

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & in cases when
  multiple sentiments overlap with each other and emo-expression
  element is located in an overlapping span of both of them this edge
  should point to sentiment on which this emo-expression has immediate
  impact\\\hline
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\xmltag{negation}}
\texttt{\xmltag{negation}}s are lexical or syntactic elements which
reverse primary polar meaning of emo-expressions to the opposite, so
that the overall polarity of whole sentiment are different to the
polarity of emo-expressions belonging to it. A typical example of
negation is \textit{nicht} in sentences like \textit{Ein guter Schritt
  war diese Entscheidung \textbf{nicht}.} (\textit{This decision was
  \textbf{not} a good move.}).

\subsubsection{Examples}
You SHOULD only mark negative elements which have impact on
sentiment's polarity. Negating elements which have no such impact
shold not be marked. Negation elements are usually represented by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Negation particle \textit{nicht} (\textit{not}),
    e.g. \textit{Klug ist dieser Hund sicherlich \textbf{nicht}}
    (\textit{This dog is certainly \textbf{not} clever});

  \item Negative article \textit{kein} e.g. \textit{Er war
    \textbf{kein} Vorbild f\"ur seine Kindet} (\textit{He was
    \textbf{not} a good example for his children});

  \item Indefinite pronouns like \textit{niemand}, \textit{keiner}
    etc., e.g. \textit{\textbf{Niemand} hielt ihn f\"ur einen
      ehrlichen Menschen.} (\textit{\textbf{Nobody} considered him an
      honest man});

  \item Any lexical or idiomatic unit in case they turn sentiment's
    polarity to the opposite, e.g. \textit{Ich \textbf{zweifle}, dass
      das neue iPhone ein besseres Display hat.} (\textit{I
      \textbf{doubt} that new iPhone has better display}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Counter-Examples}
DO NOT mark as negations elements which have no effect on sentiment's
polarity. For example, in sentence \textit{Ich mag Leute, die nicht
  nur an sich selbst denken} (\textit{I like people who care not only
  about themselves}) \textit{nicht} (\textit{not}) should not be
marked as negation, since it does not change positive polarit
expressed by \textit{m\"ogen} (\textit{like}).

\subsubsection{Attributes}
Negations have only one possible attribute, namely
\textit{sentiment-ref} which is a directed edge pointing from negation
to sentiment it pertains to. You should only draw this edge in cases
when multiple sentiment relations overlap with each other and it's not
obvious to which of these sentiments given negation belongs to,
i.e. in cases when given negation is included in both sentiment spans.

\subsection{\xmltag{intensifier}}
\texttt{\xmltag{intensifier}}s are elements which increase polar
meaning of emotional expressions. Intensifiers are usually expressed
by adjectives or adverbs like \textit{sehr} (\textit{very}),
\textit{ziemlich} (\textit{rather}) etc.

\subsubsection{Attributes}
Intensifiers have following attributes and values:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.6\textwidth}|}\hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{degree} & \textit{1 (default)} & degree by which
  this intensifier increases polar sense of respective emotional
  expression (1 means slight increase), e.g. \textit{ziemlich},
  \textit{recht} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{2} & this intensifier strongly increases polar sense of
  emotional expression, e.g. \textit{sehr}, \textit{super},
  \textit{stark} etc.\\\hline

  %%%%%%

  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & a directed
  edge pointing from intensifier to sentiment it pertains to. By
  analogy to negations, you should only draw this edge in cases when
  multiple sentiment relations overlap with each other and it's not
  obvious to which of these sentiments given intensifier belongs to,
  i.e. in cases when given intensifier is included in both sentiment
  spans\\\hline
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\xmltag{diminisher}}
\texttt{\xmltag{diminisher}}s are elements which decrease polar
meaning of emotional expressions. Like intensifiers diminishers are
usually expressed by adjectives or adverbs. Typical examples of such
adverbs are \textit{wenig}, \textit{kaum}, \textit{ein bisschen} etc.

\subsubsection{Attributes}
Diminishers have same attributes as intensifiers with the only
difference in values of \textit{degree} attribute. So here is once
again a suumary table of diminisher's attributes:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.6\textwidth}|}\hline
  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & a directed
  edge pointing from diminisher to sentiment it pertains to. You
  should only draw this edge in cases when multiple sentiment
  relations overlap with each other and it's not obvious to which of
  these sentiments given diminisher belongs to, i.e. in cases when
  given diminisher is included in both sentiment spans\\\hline

  %%%%%%

  \multirow{2}{*}{degree} & \textit{-1 (default)} & degree by which
  this diminisher decreases polar sense of respective emotional
  expression (1 means slight decrease), e.g. \textit{wenig},
  \textit{bisschen} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{-2} & this diminisher strongly decreases polar sense of
  emotional expression almost turning the sense of emo-expression to
  the opposite, e.g. \textit{kaum} etc.\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
