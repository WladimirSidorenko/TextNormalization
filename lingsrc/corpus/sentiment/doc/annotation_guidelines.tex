\section{Overview}
\subsection{Introduction}

In this assignment, your task is to annotate sentiments in a corpus of
Twitter messages.  We define \emph{sentiments} as polar (either
positive or negative) evaluative subjective opinions about some
persons, subjects, or events.  In this assignment, you have to
annotate both -- text spans denoting the opinions (\emph{sentiments})
and text spans denoting the subjects and events being evaluated
(\emph{sentiment targets}).  Additionally, you should also mark
opinions' holders (\emph{sentiment sources}) and lexical elements
which might significantly change the polarity and intensity of a
sentiment.  The latter elements include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{emotional expressions}, which are words or phrases that
    unequivocally possess some evaluative lexical meaning by
    themselves (these are typically words like \emph{hassen}
    (\emph{hate}), \emph{bewundern} (\emph{admire}), \emph{sch\"on}
    (\emph{nice}) etc.);
  \item \emph{negations}, which are words or expressions that might
    completely flip the polarity of an emotional expression or a
    sentiment to the opposite (e.g. \emph{nicht} gut (\emph{not}
    good), \emph{kein} Talent (\emph{not} a talent) etc.);
  \item \emph{intensifiers} and \emph{diminishers} (or
    \emph{downtoners}), which are words and expressions that might
    increase or decrease the evaluative sense of an emotional
    expression, respectively.  Examples of intensifiers include words
    like \emph{sehr} (\emph{very}), \emph{besonders}
    (\emph{especially}), \emph{insbesondere} (\emph{particularly})
    etc.  Typical examples of diminishers are words like \emph{ein
      wenig} (\emph{a little}), \emph{ein bisschen} (\emph{a bit}),
    \emph{gewisserma\ss{}en} (\emph{to a certain degree}) etc.
\end{itemize}

After marking these elements, you should also specify the values of
their attributes.  A complete list of all elements to be marked along
with the description of their possible attributes is given in Section
\ref{sec:markables}.  In Section \ref{sec:faq}, we also answer some
questions which caused special difficulties during the previous runs
of annotation.  Finally, Section \ref{sec:examples} gives a couple of
annotation examples in order to give you a grasp of how a complete
annotation should look like.

\subsection{Terminology and Format}
\textbf{Terminology.} Throughout this document, we will use the term
\emph{markable} to denote an annotated span of text.  The term
\emph{markable type} (or \emph{markable tag}) will refer to the tag
assigned to a markable.  Additional attributes associated with the
annotated text spans will be called \emph{markable attributes}.

We will not make a distinction between the terms \emph{opinions} and
\emph{sentiments} and will use both words interchangeably.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Format.} In these guidelines, we rely
on the following conventions regarding the formatting of text.

We specify shell commands in gray boxes in \texttt{typesetting} font
as shown in the example below: \code{echo 'Hello world!'}  The
\texttt{typesetting} font is also used for literal mentions of
markable types, markable attributes, file names, directory paths, and
executable commands.

Examples of words and phrases are given in \textit{italics} and their
respective English translation is provided in parentheses.

Examples of sentence annotations are shown in regular font. Text
enclosed in markables is \emph{emphasized} and surrounded by square
brackets (e.g. [\emph{markable text}]).  The type of the markables is
given as a subscript after the closing right bracket; optional
markable attributes are specified after the type, separated from it by
a colon, e.g.:
\begin{exmp}
  \sentiment[polarity=positive]{\target{Der neue Papst} gilt als
    \emoexpression{bescheidener}, \emoexpression{zur\"uckgenommener}
    Typ.}

{\footnotesize(\sentiment[polarity=positive]{\target{The new Pope} is
    believed to be a \emoexpression{sober}, \emoexpression{modest}
    man.})}\label{exmp:1}
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Annotation Tool}

For annotating text, you should use \texttt{MMAX2} -- a freely
available annotation tool -- which you can download under the
following link:

{\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}\small\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmax2/files/mmax2/mmax2_1.13.003/MMAX2_1.13.003b.zip/download}}

After downloading this file, you should unpack the received archive,
change to the newly created directory \texttt{1.13.003/MMAX2} in your
terminal shell and execute the following commands: \code{chmod u+x
  ./mmax2.sh\\ nohup ./mmax2.sh \&} An \texttt{MMAX2} window should
then appear on your screen.  If you have never used \texttt{MMAX2}
before, please read the document \texttt{mmax2quickstart.pdf}, which
you can find in the subdirectory \texttt{MMAX2/Docs} of the downloaded
archive.

\subsection{Corpus Files}

You should also have received a copy of corpus files either as a
tar-gzipped archive or via the version control system \texttt{Git}.

If you got a \texttt{.tgz} archive of the corpus, then unpack it using
the command: \code{tar -xzf archive-name.tgz} After that, a directory
called \corpusDir{} should appear in your current folder.

If you received access to the \texttt{Git} repository of the project,
you should clone the project to your local computer with the command:
\code{git clone
  ssh://hebe.ling.uni-potsdam.de/var/local/git/Depot/socmedia
  local-dir} Then, you should find a folder called
\texttt{annotator-x}, where \texttt{x} stands for the annotator ID
that was assigned to you, in the directory
\texttt{local-dir/lingsrc/corpus/} \corpusDir{}.

In order to load an annotation file into your \texttt{MMAX2} program,
you should change to the \texttt{MMAX2} window and click on the menu
\texttt{File -> Load}.  In the displayed pop-up window, select the
path to the \corpusDir{}\texttt{/anno\-ta\-tor-x}
folder\footnote{Please, make sure that the path to the \corpusDir{}
  folder does not contain any white spaces.  Otherwise, \texttt{MMAX2}
  might fail to load the project.} and click on one of the
\texttt{*.mmax} files found there.  The chosen project should then be
loaded into your \texttt{MMAX2} editor.

If you have any difficulties with launching \texttt{MMAX2} or loading
the project files into your editor, please contact the author of these
guidelines via e-mail (\authorAddress{}).

\section{Tags and Attributes}\label{sec:markables}
In the following, we provide a short list of all markables and their
possible attributes that will be used in this annotation task:

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{sentiment}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{polarity},
    \item \texttt{intensity},
    \item \texttt{sarcasm};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{target}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{preferred},
    \item \texttt{anaph-ref},
    \item \texttt{sentiment-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{source}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{anaph-ref},
    \item \texttt{sentiment-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{emo-expression}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{polarity},
    \item \texttt{intensity},

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{degree},
    \item \texttt{emo-expression-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item and, finally, the \texttt{negation}-markable with the
    attribute:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{emo-expression-ref}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent{}A more detailed description o these markables and the
values of their respective attributes is given in the next
subsections.

\subsection{sentiment}\label{sec:sentiment}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} With the \texttt{sentiment} tags, you
should mark polar evaluative opinions about people, subjects, or
events.  Typical examples of sentiment statements are sentences like
the following one:
\begin{exmp}
  \sentiment{Ich mag den neuen James Bond Film nicht}.

  (\sentiment{I don't like the new James Bond
    movie}.)\label{ex:sentiment}
\end{exmp}
\noindent which expresses a negative judgement about a new movie.

According to our definition, a sentiment must always fulfill the
following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item it has to be \textbf{subjective}, i.e. you should not mark as
  \texttt{sentiment}s mere statements of facts like, for example,
  \textit{Beim Angriff wurden 14 Glasscheiben besch\"adigt}
  (\textit{14 glass plates were broken during the attack}); there
  should always be a personal opinion of the author or some person or
  institution being cited;

\item it has to be \textbf{polar}, i.e. a sentiment should always
  reflect either positive or negative attitude to its respective
  target.  Cases like \textit{Ich glaube, er wird heute fr\"uher
    kommen} (\textit{I think he will be earlier today}) should not be
  marked as sentiments because the attitude of the author is unclear,
  though these statements are subjective;

\item a sentiment has to be \textbf{evaluative}, which means that it
  should always refer to an explicit target.  You should not mark as
  sentiments cases like \textit{Ich bin heute so gl\"ucklich}
  (\textit{I am so happy today}), because these statements do not
  evaluate anything in particular.
\end{itemize}

We also consider contrastive comparisons to be a special type of
evaluative opinions.  Unlike other types of sentiments, however,
contrastive comparisons typically express a relative evaluation,
i.e. an object is regarded to be either better or worse than another
compared object, but we usually do not know if the author actually
likes or dislikes either of them.  To help us distiguish such cases,
you should set the \texttt{polarity} attribute of such sentiments to
the special value \texttt{comparison} (cf. Table \ref{tbl:sentiment}).

You should not mark as sentiments polar opinions for which its unknown
if their are true or not.  These typically are sentences like
\textit{Ich wei\ss{} nicht, ob ich meinen Bruder mag} (\textit{I don't
  know if I like my brother}).  In this example, neither we nor the
author actually know if the author likes or dislikes her brother.
Exceptions from this are cases like \textit{Ich zweifle, dass er ein
  guter Mensch ist} (\textit{I doubt that he is a good man}) or
\textit{Ich glaube nicht, dass er diesen Preis verdient hat}
(\textit{I don't think that he has deserved this award}) which express
author's disagreement with some positive evaluation and, therefore,
act themselves as a negative judgement about the target.  Special care
should be taken when dealing with questions and irrealis clauses
(cf. Questions \ref{qstn:interrogative} and \ref{qstn:irrealis} in
\nameref{sec:faq} Section of this document).

\noindent\textbf{Boundaries.} Text spans annotated with the
\texttt{sentiment} tags should include both the object being evaluated
(the target) and the actual phrase phragment which expresses the
evaluation.  After determining these two elements, you should put the
\texttt{sentiment} tags around the \emph{minimal complete syntactic or
  discourse-level unit} in which both elements appear together.

In Example \ref{exmp:book}, for instance, the evaluated object is
\textit{Buch} (\textit{book}), the evaluative expression is
\textit{langweiliges} (\textit{boring}), and the minimal syntactic
unit which simultaneously covers both of these elements is the noun
phrase \textit{ein langweiliges Buch} (\textit{a boring book}).  We
therefore put the \texttt{sentiment} tags around this noun phrase but
do not put anything else inside them.
\begin{exmp}
  Auf dem Tisch lag \sentiment{ein langweiliges Buch}.

  (There was \sentiment{a boring book} on the table.)\label{exmp:book}
\end{exmp}
Sentiments are not restricted to just noun phrases, they can also be
expressed by complete clauses or even multiple sentences
(discourse-level units).  The main point is that a \texttt{sentiment}
span has to be \emph{complete}, i.e. it has to include both target and
evaluation, and \emph{minimal}, i.e. if target and evaluation are
captured by a particular syntactic or discourse-level unit neither
parent not siblings of this unit should be included in that
\texttt{sentiment} markable.

Example \ref{exmp:petterson} shows how a sentiment relation can be
expressed by a clause:
\begin{exmp}
  Wir akzeptieren das, weil \sentiment{wir alle ein bisschen in
    Petterson verliebt sind}.

  (We accept this because \sentiment{we all are a little bit in love
    with Petterson}.)\label{exmp:petterson}
\end{exmp}
\noindent In this sentence, the evaluative statement is made about
\textit{Petterson} who is sentiment's target.  The author says that
they all \textit{in ihn verliebt sind} (\textit{are in love with him})
which is her subjective evaluative opinion.  Both the target and the
evaluative expression appear together in the verb phrase with the head
verb \textit{be}.  So, we mark this complete verb phrase including its
grammatical subject \textit{wir} (\textit{we}).

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item single noun phrases, possibly with their prepositional
%%   attributes, e.g. \textit{Auf dem Tisch lag \sentiment{ ein
%%       langweiliges Buch} (There was \sentiment{a boring book} on the
%%     table)};
%% \item clauses, e.g. \textit{\sentiment{Ich hasse B\"ucher ohne
%%   Inhaltsangabe}. (\sentiment{I hate books without table of
%%   contents})};
%% \item multiple sentences in cases when these sentences jointly form a
%%   sentiment relation, e.g.\\\textit{\sentiment{Sie denken, reden,
%%       riechen, lieben, schmecken, f*cken Plastik. Sie haben\\das so
%%       gelernt in der Plastik-Werbewelt}.\\ (\sentiment{They think and
%%       speak about, smell at, love, taste, f*ck plastic.  They
%%       have\\ learned it so in the advertising world of plastic}.)}.
%% \end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} After you have marked the
\texttt{sentiment} span, you should next set the values of its
attributes.  Acceptable attributes, their meaning and values are given
in Table \ref{tbl:sentiment}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[ht]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{sentiment}s.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline
      Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      & \textit{positive} & sentiment expresses positive attitude about
      its respective target, e.g. \textit{Es war ein fantastischer Abend
        (It was a fantastic evening)};\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{negative\newline(default)} & sentiment expresses
      negative attitude about its respective target, e.g. \textit{Seine
        Schwester ist einfach unausstehlich (His sister is simply
        obnoxious)}\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-3}{*}{polarity} & \textit{comparison} & sentiment
      expresses a comparison of two objects with preference given to one
      of them, e.g. \textit{Mir gef\"allt das rote Kleid mehr als das
        blaue (I like the red dress more than the blue one)}\\\hline

      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      & \textit{weak} & sentiment expresses a weak evaluative opinion,
      e.g. \textit{Der Auftritt war mehr oder weniger gut (The
        appearance was more or less good)}\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{medium\newline(default)} & sentiment has a middle
      emotional expressivity, e.g. \textit{Mir hat das neue Album gut
        gefallen (I enjoyed the new album)}\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-3}{*}{intensity} & \textit{strong} & this sentiment
      expresses a very emotional polar statement, e.g. \textit{Dieses
        Festival war einfach umwerfend!!! (This festival was simply
        terrific!!!)}\\\hline
      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      \multirow{2}{*}{sarcasm} & \textit{true} & this polar attitude is
      derisive, i.e. its actual polarity is the opposite of its apparent
      form. (An apparent praise, for example, could be meant as a rebuke
      and vice versa. The actual sense, however, can only be inferred on
      the basis of world knowledge or reasoning.)  An example of a
      sarcastic sentiment is the following passage: \textit{Mein
        J\"ungerer ist in der Pr\"ufung durchgefallen.  Klasse! (My
        youngest has failed his exam.  Well done!)}  In this case, you
      should set the polarity attribute of the sentiment to
      \texttt{negative} and the value of the \texttt{sarcasm} attribute
      to \textit{true}.\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{false\newline(default)} & no sarcasm is present -- the
      polar attitude has its literal meaning; this is the default.
      setting\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:sentiment}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{target}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} You should mark with the \texttt{target}
tags objects or events which are being evaluated by sentiment
expressions.  An example of a sentiment target is given in the
following sentence:
\begin{exmp}
Mein Bruder ist nicht begeistert von \target{dem neuen Call of Duty}.

(My brother is not impressed by \target{the new Call of Duty}.)
\end{exmp}
\noindent{}Because sentiments are required to be evaluative, there
MUST always be at least one target for each sentiment relation.

\noindent\textbf{Boundaries.} Similar to sentiments, you should put
the \texttt{target} tags around the minimal complete syntactic or
discourse-level units which denote the evaluated objects or events.
These are usually noun phrases (e.g. \textit{Mir wird's schlecht, wenn
  ich \target{diese Werbung} im Fernsehen sehe} (\textit{I feel sick
  when I see this \target{ad} on TV})) or clauses (e.g. \textit{Ich
  hasse es wenn \target{Voldemort mein Shampoo benutzt.}} (\textit{I
  hate it when \target{Voldemort is using my shampoo}})).

If a sentiment has multiple targets, you should mark each of these
targets separately (cf. Example \ref{exmp:trg-conj}).
\begin{exmp}
  Meiner Mutter haben immer \target{Nelken} und \target{Dahlien}
  gefallen.

  (My mother has always liked \target{carnations} and
  \target{dahlias}.)\label{exmp:trg-conj}
\end{exmp}

In comparisons, you should also separately annotate each compared
objects.  Additionally, for the object which is being dispreferred,
you should set the \texttt{preferred} attribute to \texttt{false}
(cf. Example \ref{exmp:trg-comp}).
\begin{exmp}
  Ich mag \target{Domino-Eis} mehr als
  \target[preferred=false]{Magnum}.

  (I like the \target{Domino ice cream} more than
  \target[preferred=false]{Magnum}.)\label{exmp:trg-comp}
\end{exmp}

\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} Further possible attributes of the
\texttt{target} tags along with their allowed values are shown in
Table \ref{tbl:target}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{target}s.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.94\clmnwidth}|}\hline
      Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline

      & \textit{true} (default) & in comparisons, this value means that
      the respective target is being considered better than another
      compared object, e.g. \textit{\emph{Die neue Frisur} passt ihr
        garantiert besser als die alte (\emph{The new hairstyle} suits
        her definitely better than the old one)};\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-2}{*}{preferred} & \textit{false} & in comparisons,
      this value marks the target element which is being considered
      worse than its counterpart, e.g. \textit{Die zweite Saison von
        Breaking Bad war viel spannender als \emph{die dritte} (The
        second season of Breaking Bad was much more exciting than
        \emph{the third one})};\\\hline

      sentiment-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
        edge)} & directed edge pointing from \texttt{target} to its
      respective \texttt{sentiment}.  You need to draw this edge in
      two cases:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item when the \texttt{target} is located at intersection of two
        different \texttt{sentiment}s (in this case, you should draw
        an edge from \texttt{target} to \texttt{sentiment}, which this
        \texttt{target} actually belongs to),

      \item when the target of an opinion is expressed outside the
        \texttt{sentiment} span;
      \end{itemize}\\\hline

      anaph-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed edge)} &
      directed edge pointing from \texttt{target} expressed by a
      pronoun or pronominal adverb to its respective non-pronominal
      antecedent (in order to draw this edge, you also need to mark
      the antecedent as \texttt{target})\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:target}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Source
\subsection{source}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} With the \texttt{source} tag, you should
annotate the immediate author(s) or holder(s) of an evaluative
opinion.  These are typically writers of messages or persons or
institutions whose opinion is being cited.  If sentiment's source of
is not explicitly mentioned in a message, we then assume that it is
the author of the tweet. You need not mark anything with the
\texttt{source} tag in this case.  An example of an explicit sentiment
\texttt{source} is the pronoun \textit{Sie} (\textit{she}) in Example
\ref{exmp:source}.
\begin{exmp}
  \source{Sie} mag die neue Farbe nicht

  (\source{She} doesn't like the new color)\label{exmp:source}
\end{exmp}

In case of citations, you should only mark as \texttt{source} person
or institution whose original opinion is being cited.  Do not mark the
citing persons (cf. Example \ref{exmp:source-citation}).
\begin{exmp}
  Laut Staatsanwalt soll die \source{Angeklagte} sich missbilligend \"uber
  ihren Vorgesetzten ge\"au\ss{}ert haben.

  (According to the attorney, the \source{defendant} had made
  disapproving remarks about her boss.)\label{exmp:source-citation}
\end{exmp}

\noindent\textbf{Boundaries.} For determining the boundaries of the
\texttt{source}, you should proceed in similar fashion as we did for
\texttt{sentiment}s and \texttt{target}s and mark only complete
minimal syntactic units.  Sources are most commonly expressed by noun
phrases.  And, similar to \texttt{target}s, if the source of a
sentiment is expressed by multiple coordinatively joined noun phrases,
you should mark each of them separately (cf. Example
\ref{exmp:source2}).

\begin{exmp}
  \source{Ihr} und \source{ihrer Mutter} gef\"allt die neue Farbe
  nicht.\\ (Neither \source{she} and \source{her mother} likes the new
  color)\label{exmp:source2}
\end{exmp}

\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} The attributes of the \texttt{source}
tag are listed in Table \ref{tbl:source}.  They are fully identical to

%% Emo-expression
\subsection{emo-expression}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} With the \texttt{emo-expression} tags,
you should annotate words and phrases which have a polar evaluative
lexical meaning by themselves.  An example of emotional expression is
the word \textit{ekelhaft} (\textit{disgusting}) in Example
\ref{exmp:emo-expr1}.
\begin{exmp}
  Beim Aufr\"aumen des Zimmers haben wir einen
  \emoexpression{ekelhaften} Teller mit verschimmeltem Essen unter dem
  Bett gefunden.

  (When we cleaned the room, we found a \emoexpression{disgusting}
  plate with moldy food under the bed.)\label{exmp:emo-expr1}
\end{exmp}

\noindent{}In contrast to \texttt{source}s and \texttt{target}s which
should only be marked in the presence of a \texttt{sentiment}, you
should always annotate emotional expressions in text no matter if an
evaluative \texttt{sentiment} is present or not in their vicinity.

Since many words and idioms are ambiguous and can express many
different lexical meanings, it is often the case that only some of
these lexical senses are evaluative and subjective.  In such cases,
you should only mark as \texttt{emo-expression}s words whose actual
meaning in the given context is polar.  If these words express an
objective sense in other messages, you should not annotate them
(cf. Example \ref{exmp:emo-expression-jewel}).
\begin{exmp}
  Dieser Wein ist ein echtes \emoexpression{Juwel} in meiner
  Kollektion.

  (This wine is a real \emoexpression{jewel} in my collection.)

  Koh-i-Noor ist das teuerste Juwel heutzutage.

  (Koh-i-Noor is the most expensive jewel nowadays.)\label{exmp:emo-expression-jewel}
\end{exmp}
\noindent{}In this example, the meaning of the word \textit{Juwel}
(\textit{jewel}) is metaphoric and subjective in the first sentence,
but literal and objective in the second.  So you should only annotate
this word in the former case but not in the latter.

\noindent\textbf{Boundaries.} \texttt{emo-expression}s are typically
expressed by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item nouns, e.g. \textit{Held (hero)}, \textit{Ideal (ideal)},
    \textit{Betr\"uger (fraudster)} etc.;

  \item adjectives or adverbs, e.g. \textit{sch\"on (nice)},
    \textit{zuverl\"assig (reliably)}, \textit{hinterh\"altig
      (devious)}, \textit{heimt\"uckisch (insidiously)} etc.;

  \item verbs, e.g. \textit{lieben (to love)}, \textit{bewundern (to
    admire)}, \textit{hassen (to hate)} etc.;

  \item idioms, e.g. \textit{auf die Nerven gehen (to get on one's
    nerves)} etc.;

  \item smileys, e.g. :), :-(, \smiley{}, \frownie{} etc.;
\end{itemize}
In case of idiomatic expressions, you should always annotate complete
idioms.  For verbs, if they only take on an evaluative sense when used
along with some preposition (e.g. \textit{to go for sth.} in the sense
of \textit{to like}), you should annotate both the verb and the
preposition as a single markable (please refer to the \texttt{MMAX}
manual to see how to annotate discontinuous spans).

\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} When determining the value of the
\texttt{polarity} attribute of an \texttt{emo-expression}, you should
disregard any possible contextual modifiers like intensifiers or
negations, however, and set the value of this attribute to the lexical
(or also called \emph{prior}) polarity of the \texttt{emo-expression}
word (the one which it expresses without negations) (cf. Example
\ref{exmp:emo-expression-polarity}).
\begin{exmp}
Es war keine \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{gute} Idee.

(It was not a \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{good} idea.)\label{exmp:emo-expression-polarity}
\end{exmp}

Also, when you are determining the value of the \texttt{polarity}
attribute, you should analyze this polarity from the perspective of
the subject or event which is being evaluated by the
\texttt{emo-expression} (if this subject is present in the context).
It means that if we are speaking about \textit{a nice book}, the
polarity expressed towards the book is positive, conversely \textit{a
  boring book} expresses a negative polarity.  Note, however, that in
cases like \textit{Ich vermisse meine Freundin} (\textit{I miss my
  girlfriend}), the polarity is still positive because the author
evidently has a positive attitude to his girlfriend despite (or better
to say proven by) the fact that he is suffering from her absence.

Further attributes of \texttt{emo-expression}s include
\texttt{intensity}, \texttt{sarcasm}, and \texttt{sentiment-ref}.  The
meaning and the values of these attributes are listed in Table
\ref{tbl:emo-expression}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[ht]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{emo-expression}s.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.935\clmnwidth}|}\hline
      Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      & \textit{positive} & emotional expression has a positive
      evaluative meaning, e.g. \textit{gut (good), verhimmeln (to
        ensky), Prachtkerl (corker)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-2}{*}{polarity} & \textit{negative\newline(default)}
      & emotional expression has a negative evaluative meaning towards
      its target, e.g. \textit{versauen (to botch up), rotzig
        (snotty), Dreckskerl (scum)} etc.\\\hline

      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      & \textit{weak} & emo-expression has a weak evaluative sense,
      e.g. \textit{solala (so-so), nullachtf\"unfzehn (vanilla),
        durchschnittlich (mediocre)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{medium\newline(default)} & emo-expression has middle
      stylistic expressivity, e.g. \textit{gut (good), schlecht (bad),
        robust (tough)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-3}{*}{intensity} & \textit{strong} & emo-expression
      expresses a very strong positive or negative evaluation,
      e.g. \textit{allerbeste (bettermost), zum Kotzen (to make one
        puke), Kacke (shit)} etc.\\\hline

      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      \multirow{2}{*}{sarcasm} & \textit{true} & emo-expression is
      derisive, i.e. its actual polarity is the opposite of its
      apparent form. (This means that an apparent praise which appears
      in text is in fact meant as a rebuke and vice versa. The actual
      sense, however, can only be inferred on the basis of world
      knowledge or reasoning.)\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{false\newline(default)} & no sarcasm is present -- the
      polar attitude has its literal meaning; this is the default
      setting\\\hline

      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      sentiment-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
        edge)} & arrow pointing to the \texttt{sentiment} which this
      \texttt{emo-expression} belongs to.  You should only draw this
      edge if an \texttt{emo-expression} is located in the overlapping
      of two \texttt{sentiment} spans or outside of the
      \texttt{sentiment} span which it belongs to\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:emo-expression}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Intensifier
\subsection{intensifier}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} Intensifiers are elements which increase
the expressivity and the polar sense of an emotional expression.  An
example of intensifier is the word \textit{sehr (very)} in Example
\ref{exmp:intensifier}.
\begin{exmp}
  Wir suchen eine \intensifier{sehr} zuverl\"assige Polin als
  Haushaltshilfe.

  (We are looking for a \intensifier{very} reliable Polish woman as
  domestic help.)\label{exmp:intensifier}
\end{exmp}
\noindent\textbf{Boundaries.} Intensifiers are usually expressed by
adverbs or adjectives like \textit{sehr (very), sicherlich
  (certainly)} etc.  But other ways of expressions are still possible
(cf. Example \ref{exmp:intensifier-comp}).
\begin{exmp}
  Dieser Junge ist stark \intensifier{wie ein Pferd}.

  (This boy is strong \intensifier{as a
    horse}.)\label{exmp:intensifier-comp}
\end{exmp}

\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} An \texttt{intensifier} should always
relate to some \texttt{emo-expression} and you should also always
explicitly show that relation by drawing an edge attribute from
\texttt{intensifier} to its respective \texttt{emo-expression}
markable.

Further possible attributes of \texttt{intensifier}s are shown in
Table \ref{tbl:intensifier}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[htb]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{intensifier}s.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.875\clmnwidth}|}\hline

      & \textit{medium (default)} & the intensifier moderately
      increases the polar sense of the emotional expression,
      e.g. \textit{ziemlich (quite), recht (fairly)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-2}{*}{degree} & \textit{strong} & the intensifier
      strongly increases the polar sense and stylistic markedness of the
      emotional expression, e.g. \textit{sehr (very), super (super),
        stark (strongly)} etc.\\\hline

      %%%%%%

      emo-expression-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
        edge)} & a directed edge pointing from the intensifier to the
      \texttt{emo-expression} whose meaning is being intensified\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:intensifier}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

\subsection{diminisher}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} With the \texttt{diminisher} tag, you
should annotate words and phrases that decrease the polar lexical
sense of an \texttt{emo-expression}.  In Example
\ref{exmp:diminisher}, the diminisher is expressed by the adverb
\textit{weniger} (\textit{less}.
\begin{exmp}
  \diminisher{Weniger} erfolgreiche Unternehmen verzichten auf externe
  Berater.\label{exmp:diminisher}

  The \diminisher{less} successful companies do not use external
  consultants.
\end{exmp}
\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} Just like intensifiers, diminishers
should always relate to some emotional expression and you should also
explicitly show this relation by drawing an edge.

The attributes of the diminishers mainly correspond to that of
intensifiers.  The only difference concerns the \textit{degree}
attribute which shows how strong an \texttt{intensifier}
\emph{increases} but a \texttt{diminisher} \emph{decreases} the
lexical sense of an \texttt{emo-expression}.  A list of possible
attributes for the \texttt{diminisher}s is provided in Table
\ref{tbl:diminisher}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[hb]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{diminisher}s.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.88\clmnwidth}|}\hline

      & \textit{medium (default)} & diminisher moderately decreases
      the polar sense of its respective \texttt{emo-expression},
      e.g. \textit{wenig (few), bisschen (little)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-2}{*}{degree} & \textit{strong} & diminisher strongly
      decreases the polar sense of the \texttt{emo-expression},
      e.g. \textit{kaum (hardly)} etc.\\\hline

      emo-expression-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
        edge)} & see Table \ref{tbl:intensifier}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:diminisher}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

\subsection{negation}
\noindent\textbf{Definition.} With the \texttt{negation} tag, you
should mark elements which turn the polarity of an
\texttt{emo-expression} to its complete opposite.  In Example
\ref{exmp:negation}, for instance, the negative article \textit{kein}
(\textit{not}) makes the \emph{contextual} polarity of the word
\textit{interessant} (\textit{interesting}) to be negative despite
that the prior polarity of this word is unequivocally positive.
\begin{exmp}
Diese Geschichte war \"uberhaupt nicht \negation{interessant}!

This story was \negation{not} interesting at all!\label{exmp:negation}
\end{exmp}
Like intensifiers and diminishers, negations should always relate to
some \texttt{emo-expression} and you should also show this relation
with an edge.

The role and the meaning of negations are closely related to that of
diminishers.  In order to help you better differentiate between these
elements, we have listed the most obvious differences between the two
classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item\textit{Semantic differences}.  While the diminishers only
    decrease the lexical sense of an emo-expression, a part of this
    original sense still remains active (i.e. \textit{a hardly
      understandable speech} is still understandable); negations, on
    the contrary, fully deny that meaning and turn it to the complete
    opposite (\textit{a not understandable speech} is absolutely
    unintelligible);

  \item\textit{Part-of-speech differences}.  While diminishers are
    usually expressed by adjectives or adverbs, negations are
    typically represented by the negative article \textit{kein (no)},
    the negation particle \textit{nicht (not)}, or verbs or
    adjectives, e.g.  \textit{Es ist sehr zweifelhaft, dass die neue
      Version von Windows besser wird} (\textit{It is very doubtful
      that the new Windows version will be any better})

  %% \item\textit{Syntactic differences}.  While diminishers are usually
  %%   expressed by either adjectives or adverbs; negations, on the contrary,
  %%   are commonly represented by either the negative article \textit{kein
  %%   (no)} or the negation particle \textit{nicht (not)}, or even complete
  %%   clauses (\textit{Er ist nicht einverstanden, dass die neue Version von
  %%   Windows besser ist (He disagrees that the new Windows version is any
  %%   better)}).
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Attributes.} The only attribute of negations is the
mandatory edge \texttt{emo-expression-ref}.  We describe the meaning
of this attribute in Table \ref{tbl:negation}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{negation}s.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{0.875\clmnwidth}|}\hline
      emo-expression-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
        edge)} & an edge from \texttt{negation} to the
      \texttt{emo-expression} being negated\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:negation}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
To summarize, your task in this assignment is to find subjective
evaluative opinions about some subjects or events.  You should
annotate these opinions with the \texttt{sentiment} tags and determine
the polarity and the intensity of the expressed attitudes.  After
that, you should annotate subjects and events which are being
evaluated and mark them as \texttt{target}s.  The holders of the
opinions should be annotated as \texttt{source}s.  Both,
\texttt{source}s and \texttt{target}s can only exist in the presence
of a \texttt{sentiment}.

Another important task is to annotate words and phrases which convey a
polar evaluative meaning by themselves.  We call these words
\texttt{emo-expression}s and you should always annotate them
regardless of whether a sentiment relation is present or not.  If an
\texttt{emo-expression} is intensified, diminished, or negated by
another word or phrase, you should also annotate this modifying
element as \texttt{intensifier}, \texttt{diminisher}, or
\texttt{negation}, respectively.

\section{FAQ}\label{sec:faq}
This section provides some examples of difficult and controversial
annotation cases and gives possible solutions to them.  Please read it
carefully before starting the annotation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in questions?}\label{qstn:interrogative}

  \textbf{A:} It primarily depends on the type of the question.  You
  should typically distinguish two cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If it is a \textit{yes-no-question} or \textit{wh-question},
      which asks whether a particular sentiment statement is true or
      not, you should not annotate any sentiment relation in this
      sentence.  In example, in the sentence \textit{Gef\"allt dir der
        neue Rock?  (Do you like the new skirt?)}, we do not know
      whether the asked person likes or dislikes the new skirt, so we
      do not annotate a sentiment in this case;
      \ref{exm:sentiment-question2}).
      \begin{exmp}
        \sentiment{Gef\"allt dir der neue Rock}?

        (\sentiment{Do you like the new
          skirt}?)\label{exm:sentiment-question1})
      \end{exmp}
    \item If it is a \textit{wh-question}, which asks about the
      reasons or some accompanying aspects of a polar opinion, but
      does not raise the truth of this opinion to question, the
      sentiment relation should be marked (cf. Example
      \ref{exm:sentiment-question2}).
      \begin{exmp}
        \sentiment{Warum hasst du deine Schwester}?

        (\sentiment{Why do you hate your
          sister}?)\label{exm:sentiment-question2})
      \end{exmp}
  \end{itemize}

\item\textbf{Q: How should I mark sentiments in irrealis sentences?}\label{qstn:irrealis}

  If an irrealis sentence expresses a wish about a particular target,
  then you should mark the whole wish expression as a
  \texttt{sentiment}, annotate the wished property as a
  \texttt{target}, and set the value of the sentiment to
  \texttt{positive}, if the target is desired, and to negative
  otherwise.
  \begin{exmp}
    \sentiment{Es w\"are \negation{nicht} \emoexpression{schlecht},
      wenn dieses Kino \target{mehr Sitzpl\"atze} h\"atte.}

    (\sentiment{It would \negation{not} be \emoexpression{bad} if, if
      this cinema had \target{more seats}.})
  \label{exmp:irrealis-1}
\end{exmp}

  If an irrealis sentence expresses an opinion about a target, which
  could possibly be true in the future, but which currently isn't,
  then you should annotate this sentence as a \texttt{sentiment}, but
  set it \texttt{polarity} value to the opposite of what the target
  object could possibly be (cf. Example \ref{exmp:irrealis-2}).

  \begin{exmp}
    \sentiment[polarity=negative]{\target{Die Kartoffelchips}
      k\"onnten \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{besser} sein}.

    (\sentiment[polarity=negative]{\target{The potato chips} could be
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{better}}.)\label{exmp:irrealis-2}
  \end{exmp}

\item\textbf{Q: How would you annotate the following cases of comparisons?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{\textit{Seehofer hat die Gr\"unen ausgeschlossen , aber
      die Linke nicht (Seehofer has excluded the Greens, but not the
      Left)}};

    \textbf{A:} Without any further context, I cannot see any
    sentiment relation here.  So, I would probably not annotate
    anything.

  \item\textbf{\textit{Lieber starke Mitte statt linker Rand (Better
      strong middle than left edge)}};

    \textbf{A:} This is a comparison with \textit{starke Mitte (strong
      middle)} as the preferred target, and \textit{linker Rand (left
      edge)} as the dispreferred one;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Die \#spd wird lieber mit den rechten von
      \#cdu, \#csu koalieren als mit der \#linke (The \#spd will
      better form a coalition with rightists from the \#cdu, \#csu
      than with the \#linke)}};

    \textbf{A:} Here again is a comparison with the \textit{\#spd} as
    a source, the \textit{\#cdu}, \textit{\#csu} as the preferred
    targets, and the \textit{\#linke} as the dispreferred target;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Die \#AfD + vereinigt mehr \"okonomische
      Kompetenz als alle etabl. Parteien + Bunde... (The \#AfD +
      combines more economic expertise than all established parties +
      federal...)}};

    \textbf{A:} Again, a comparison with \textit{\#AFD} as the
    preferred target and \textit{established parties} and
    \textit{federal} as the dispreferred ones;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Freiheit statt Bevormundung (Freedom instead of
      paternalism)}};

    \textbf{A:} Comparison, with \textit{freedom} as the preferred
    target and \textit{paternalism} as the dispreferred one;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Fettarme Milch hat mittlerweile mehr Prozent
      wie die FDP (lowfat milk has meanwhile more percents than the
      FDP)}};

    \textbf{A:} I would rather say that this is a sarcasm about the
    FDP.  Because we usually cannot compare a bottle of milk with a
    political party.  If we do so, then usually in order to kid about
    this party;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Was ist der Unterschied zwischen einem Smart
      und der FDP ? Der Smart hat wenigstens 2 Sitze :) (What is the
      difference between a Smart and the FDP? The Smart has at least
      two seats)}};

    \textbf{A:} The same as the previous question -- sarcasm about the
    FDP;
  \end{itemize}

\item\textbf{Q: How should I determine the intensity of a comparison?}

  \textbf{A:} As for the other type of sentiments, you should estimate
  the stylistic expressivity of the sentence.  If a sentence makes a
  strong emotional statement, its intensity should be high.  Vice
  versa, non-exclamatory sentences which rather resemble objective
  statements of facts should be marked with the \texttt{medium} or
  \texttt{weak} polarity.  For example, in the sentence \textit{this
    lousy Telekom waaaaaay less reliable than O2}, the strength and
  the stylistic expressiveness are much higher than in the sentence
  \textit{Telekom has a less reliable connection than 02}.
  Consequently, you should set the value of the \texttt{intensity}
  attribute to \texttt{strong} in the former case and to
  \texttt{medium} in the latter.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate as sentiments cases like
  \textit{etw. zustimmen} (\textit{to agree with sth.}), \textit{etw.
    unterst\"utzen} (\textit{to support sth.}), \textit{sich f\"ur
    etw. entscheiden} (\textit{to opt for sth.}), and \textit{j-m
    etw. vorwerfen} (\textit{to accuse so. of sth.})?}

  \textbf{A:} These cases are a bit tricky because subjective and
  objective information are mixed here.  But we would rather say
  ``yes'' unless the context strongly suggests that the information
  expressed is purely objective.  For example, if an attorney accuses
  a defendant of a crime in the court, she is basically doing her job
  and it is not necessarily true that she has any personal attitude to
  the defendant.  On the contrary, if I accuse someone of mean tricks,
  it is usually my subjective opinion.  The same applies for the
  support: if a person supports someone's opinion, she is usually
  judging positively about it.  This, however, may not always be the
  case.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in recommendations?}

  \textbf{A:} Usually yes.  If this recommendation represents a
  personal opinion and is not a spam, and you can unambiguously
  determine the target of this opinion, then you should annotate
  sentiment here.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in defenses?}

  \textbf{A:} Usually not.  If a soldier defends his position or a PhD
  student defends her thesis, it does not necessarily imply that he or
  she likes it.  The same is true in cases when someone defenses
  another person in a dispute.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I mark sentiments in insults?}

  \textbf{A:} If you can locate the target, then yes.  For example, in
  the sentence \textit{Du bist ein Idiot! (You are an idiot!)},
  \textit{Du (You)} is the target of a negative sentiment.  On the
  contrary, in cases like \textit{Idiot!  (Idiot!)}, no target is
  expressed and therefore, according to our definition, no sentiment
  can exist.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I mark sentiments in wishes?}

  \textbf{A:} Usually, yes.  If someone expresses a wish to get or to
  do something, then this person typically also has a positive
  attitude to the desired object or activity (cf. Example \ref{exmp:desire}).

  \begin{exmp}
    \sentiment[polarity=positive]{Habe \intensifier{sooooo}
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{Lust} auf \target{einen Dattel
        / Bananen Milchshake}
      .. \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{:-)}
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{*\_{}*}}

    (
    \sentiment[polarity=positive]{\emoexpression[polarity=positive]{Am}
      \intensifier{sooooo} \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{up for}
      \target{a date / banana milk shake}
      .. \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{:-)}
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{*\_{}*}} )\label{exmp:desire}
  \end{exmp}

\item\textbf{Q: Is it possible that sources and targets are expressed
  by other means than the ones described in these guidelines?}

  \textbf{A:} Yes. These guidelines are in no way exhaustive, they
  should just provide you with a better intuition of how sources or
  targets might typically look like.

\item\textbf{Q: It is said that we should disregard negations when
  determining the polarity of an emo-expression.  What about
  sentiments, shall we take into account negations there when
  determining their polarity?}

  \textbf{A:} Yes.  The polarity of an \texttt{emo-expression}
  represents the polar sense of that single lexical item.  The
  polarity of a \texttt{sentiment}, on the contrary, shows the joint
  meaning of the whole phrase, so negations should be taken into
  account if they affect the polarity.

\item\textbf{Q: How should I annotate chains of
  intensifiers/diminishers -- each separately or the whole chain with
  one tag?}

  \textbf{A:} Each element should be tagged separately,
  e.g. \textit{Du bist die '\intensifier{aller} \intensifier{aller}'
    Beste! (You are the \intensifier{very} \intensifier{very} best!)}

\item\textbf{Q: What is target in, for example, \textit{a really nice
    weekend}.  The whole phrase?}

  \textbf{A:} No it is not the whole phrase but only the
  \textit{weekend}. \textit{really} is an intensifier and
  \textit{nice} is an emo-expression.

\item\textbf{Q: What is target in cases like \textit{Now, we will
    begin with hair coloring.  Coool!!!}.  The whole first sentence or
  only the ``hair coloring''?}

\textbf{A:} In this case, both the whole sentence and the noun phrase
could be considered as targets, because the verb phrase is in fact
semantically tantamount to the noun phrase.  If one is happy about
\textit{hair coloring}, she then is also probably happy about the
beginning of tha hair coloring.  The same is true, for example, about
a postal package and the arrival of that package.  Since information
in the verb phrase is usually more elaborate and specific than in the
noun phrase, we would recommend you to annotate the whole verb phrase
i.e. sentence in this case.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in sentences which do not
  have any explicit emotions except for the smiley at the end, like
  e.g. ``kam bis heute nichts an :(''?}

\textbf{A:} If the smiley (also called emoticon) expresses author's
attitude to the object or event described in tweet, then yes, you
should annotate such cases as sentiments.  If, on the contrary, the
emoticon only serves politeness or phatic purposes, then you should
not annotate it.  It should, however, be noted that many examples will
be boundary case and it will often depend on your interpretation.  We,
therefore, suggest you to look at the type of the emoticon being used
and to judge on them: so, for example, negative smileys like(e.g
\textit{:(}) are typcially correlated with negative sentiments
(cf. Example in question); positive emoticons, on the contrary, are
much more ambiguous and only express an evaluative judgement if they
express satisfaction or happiness of the writer about the facts stated
in tweet; the winking smileys (e.g. \textit{;-)}) are the most
ambiguous ones and tehey are only rarely involved in a sentiment
relation.

\item\textbf{Q: A sentiment is always related to some target, does the
  same apply to emo-expressions?}

\textbf{A:} No.  While it is surely true that a sentiment always
requires a target according to our definition, emotional expressions
can be any words or phrases that have a positive or negative
connotation.  So, for example, words like \textit{Erfolg}
(\textit{success}), \textit{Missgeschick} (\textit{misfortune}),
\textit{ver\"argert} (\textit{upset}) all can be considered as
emo-expressions if you think that there are positive or negative
feelings associated with them.

\item\textbf{Q: How should I judge if a word is an emo-expression?}

\textbf{A:} Emotional expressions are usually abstract concepts that
are strongly associated with some subjective polar feelings.  These
expressions will serve as our primary anchors for automatically
finding sentiments in texts.  Thus, if you can imagine the a given
abtract word can be used in some context where it would positively or
negatively characterize something, or if you have a strong polar
subjective feeling associated with that word or phrase then you should
mark it as emo-expression.  For example, we usually associate negative
emotions with words like \textit{Betrug} (\textit{fraud}),
\textit{Schuld} (\textit{guilt}), or \textit{vorwerfen}
(\textit{accuse of}).  Moreover, one can say that someone
\textit{begeht einen Betrug} (\textit{commits a fraud}), \textit{hat
  die Schuld f\"ur den Eklat} (\textit{is at fault for the scandal}),
or \textit{wird Unehrlichkeit vorgeworfen} (\textit{is accused of
  dishonesty}), and it would negatively characterize the target
person.  Therefore, we should regard these words as emo-expressions.
On the other hand, concrete terms like \textit{Stein} (\textit{stone})
or \textit{Krebs} (\textit{cancer}) should not be considered as
emotional expressions as their primary sense is objective.
Expressions which are associated with emotions but do not have a
distinct polarity, like exclamation marks, for example, should not be
marked as emo-expressions either.

\item\textbf{Q: Is it possible that sentiments are nested?}

\textbf{A:} Yes, consider, for instance, the following Example:
\begin{exmp}
  \sentiment[polarity=negative]{Schaue einen Bericht \"uber die
    \target{Brigitte Di\"at}.  \sentiment[polarity=positive]{Zu
      \emoexpression[polarity=negative]{Schwachsinn} schmeckt
      \source{mir} \target{die Schokolade} einfach
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive]{am besten}.}}

{\footnotesize(\sentiment[polarity=negative]{I'm watching a report
    about the Brigtte diet.  \sentiment[polarity=positive]{With
      idiocy, chocolate tastes for me the best.}})}\label{exmp:nested}
\end{exmp}
In this case, we have one negative sentiment about the
\textit{Brigitte Di\"at} (\textit{Brigitte diet}) which is considered
to be \textit{Schwachsinn} (\textit{idiocy}).  Another sentiment is
about chocolate which is said to taste \textit{am besten} (\textit{the
  best}).  In both cases, \textit{mir} (\textit{me}) is the source of
the respective sentiments.  Since we have two overlapping sentiments,
the source element should be annotated twice and each time linked to
its respecitve sentiment span.  The emo-expression
\textit{Schwachsinn} (\textit{idiocy}) in the second sentence should
be linked to the first (negative) sentiment, as it determines its
polarity.  Another emo-expression (\textit{am besten} (\textit{the
  best}) should be linked to the positive sentiment, in order to
disambiguate that polarity relation.


\item\textbf{Q: If a sentiment is expressed by multiple sentences
  which are discontinuous, should we also annotate intermediate
  sentences between them?}

\textbf{A:} No, you should only annotate sentences which pertain to
the sentiment.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate full stops in sentiment sentences?}

\textbf{A:} Yes.  Since in multiple sentence we usually annotate the
intermediate stops between sentences, we should annotate stops at the
end either.

\item\textbf{Q: If I annotate the whole sentence as a sentiment,
  should I also include the hyperlink(s) at the end of the sentence in
  the tags?}\label{qstn:hyperlink}

\textbf{A:} Here, you have to distinguish between cases when the
hyperlink forms a syntactic part of the sentence and cases when it
does not.  If the link is a syntactic constituent (if it, for examle,
comes after a prepostion by which it is governed), then you should
include it in the \texttt{sentiment} markable.  If the URI simply
follows the sentence and is not grammatically connected to any of its
words, then it does not form a grammatical constituent of that
sentence and, therefore, should not be annotated.

\item\textbf{Q: If the whole sentence expresses a sentiment, should I
  also include the @-mentions and retweets at the beginning of that
  sentence in the \texttt{sentiment} tags?}

\textbf{A:} For @-mentions, we apply the same rule as for hyperlinks
(cf. Question \ref{qstn:hyperlink}).  We annotate them as a part of
\texttt{sentiment}, if they form a syntactic part of the sentence, and
do not annotate them otherwise.  For retweets (e.g. \textit{RT
  @asayeed:}), we only include them in the \texttt{sentiment} tags if
the retweeted person is the immediate source of the evaluative opinion
in tweet (e.g. \textit{\sentiment{RT @asayeed: Die neue Staffel von
    Alarm f\"ur Cobra 11 k\"onnte besser sein}} (\textit{\sentiment{RT
    @asayeed: The new season of Alarm f\"ur Cobra 11 could be
    better}})).  User mention after the word \texttt{RT} should be
included in \texttt{source} tags in these cases.  -- RT and hash tag
do not belong to sentiment


\item\textbf{Q: What should we do when target and its emo-expression
  are represented by one nominal compound?}

TODO: Consider the following cases:

Die Gr\"unen haben jetzt die Chance aus dem Koalitionsgef\"angnis mit
der SPD auszubrechen " meint Martin Patzelt .

Selbst HASS

\item\textbf{Q: If I have previously marked a word as emo-expression,
  should I also always unconditionally mark that word again when it
  next appears in text?}

No, you have to decide in each case, whether the actual lexical
meaning which is activated in a given context is polar or not.  So, it
might happen that one word which is evaluative and subjective in one
context, has an objective meaning in other sentences (cf. Examples
\ref{} and \ref{}).

\begin{exmp}
  @DenisQuadt : Wer meint , die \#piraten h\"atten noch nichts
  umgesetzt, m\"oge das bitte lesen :)

{\footnotesize(@DenisQuadt : Wer meint , die \#piraten h\"atten noch
  nichts umgesetzt, m\"oge das bitte lesen :)}\label{exmp:no-emoexpr}
\end{exmp}



\end{enumerate}

\section{Examples}

In this section, we provide a couple of real-world examples of
complete annotations with explanations of our decisions.  In cases
when we do not specify an attribute for a markable, it is assumed that
tjis attribute takes its default value.

\begin{exmp}
  \footnotesize WAS HABEN ALLE MIT
  \sentiment[polarity=negative,intensity=strong,sarcasm=false]{IHREN
    \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=strong,sarcasm=false]{VERF*CKTEN}
    \target{GR\"UNEN AUGEN}}

  {\scriptsize( WHAT DO THEY ALL HAVE WITH
    \sentiment[polarity=negative,intensity=strong,sarcasm=false]{THEIR
      \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=strong,sarcasm=false]{F*CKED}
      \target{GREEN EYES}} )}\label{exmp:sarcasm}
\end{exmp}

\textbf{Explanation:} In this case, we have only an evaluative opinion
about the eyes.  It is not clear whether the author has any emotions
towards the people with green eyes, only that she finds these eyes
\textit{verf*ckt} (\textit{f*cked}).  \textit{verf*ckt} is an intense
abusive word with clear negative meaning, so we set the polarity of
this emo-expression and the sentiment it perains to to
\texttt{negative} and set the intensity of both elements to
\texttt{strong}.

\begin{exmp}
  \footnotesize\sentiment[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=true]{Wo
    ist der
    \emoexpression[polarity=positive,intensity=strong,sarcasm=true]{\#Jubel}
    von \target{\#CDU} \target{\#CSU} \& \target{\#FDP} \"uber den Tod
    der Mieterin nach \#Zwangsr\"aumung?}

  {\scriptsize(
    \sentiment[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=true]{Where
      is the
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive,intensity=strong,sarcasm=true]{\#exultation}
      of \target{\#CDU} \target{\#CSU} \& \target{\#FDP} about the
      death of the renter after forced
      \#eviction?})}\label{exmp:sarcasm}
\end{exmp}

\textbf{Explanation:} First of all, we do not mark \textit{Jubel von
  \#CDU,... \"uber den Tod von ...} (\textit{the exultation of the
  \#CDU ... about the death of ...}) as sentiment, because the
existence of this feeling is raised to question (cf. explanation for
Question \ref{qstn:interrogative} in Section \ref{sec:faq}).  On the
other hand, the mere hypothesis about the presence of such glee
feeling from the side of a political party, which should presumably
care about its potential voters, is already a sarcasm.  The
\texttt{emo-expression} which shows us that it is a sarcasm is the
word \textit{\#Jubel} (\textit{\#exultation}).  The primary sense of
this word has a positive polarity; the strength of the expressed
emotion is higher than that of the word \textit{Freude} (\textit{joy})
and we therefore set the value of the \texttt{intensity} attribute to
\texttt{high}.  Moreover, this word by itself is already meant
sarcastically in the given context, so, we accordingly set the value
of its \texttt{sarcasm} attribute to \texttt{true}.  But for all that
the word \textit{Jubel} (\textit{exultation}) has a strong intensity,
the overall way of expressing sentiment is rather subtle and does not
show high exaggeration of the author.  So, the total intensity of
that sentiment is set to \texttt{medium} rather than \texttt{high}.

A slightly more difficult case is represented by the following
example, which we will process step by step:
\begin{exmp}
  \footnotesize RT @JochenFlasbarth : Guter \#Spiegel-Titel , wie
  Welzer , Sloterdijk und andere Promi \#Nichtw\"ahler die Demokratie
  verspielen : Tr\"age , frustriert

  {\scriptsize(RT @JochenFlasbarth : A good \#Spiegel title , how
    Welzer , Sloterdijk, and other celebrity non-voters squander the
    democracy : Sluggish , frustrated)}\label{exmp:nested-2}
\end{exmp}

\textbf{Explanation:} First of all, we should look for words which
have an unambiguous lexical polarity, i.e. the emo-expressions, as
they are our primary cues when detecting a sentiment.  There is the
word \textit{guter} (\textit{good}) with an obvious positive polarity,
and there are words \textit{verspielen} (\textit{to squander}),
\textit{tr\"age} (\textit{sluggish}), \textit{frustriert}
(\textit{frustrated}), whose polarity is unequivocally negative.
Since we have two sets of emo-expressions with contradicting
polarities, it is most likely that we also have two types of
sentiments -- one with a positive evaluation and one with a negative.
The positive evaluation is made about the suggested \#Spiegel title
\textit{wie Welzer , Sloterdijk und andere Promi \#Nichtw\"ahler die
  Demokratie verspielen: Tr\"age , frustriert} (\textit{how Welzer ,
  Sloterdijk, and other celebrity non-voters squander the democracy:
  Sluggish , frustrated}).  The author thinks this title is good and
therefore has a positive attitude to the title as such.  The
annotation for that type of sentiment might look as follows:

\begin{exmp*}
  \footnotesize
  \sentiment[polarity=positive,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,id=1]{RT
    \source[sentiment\_ref=1]{@JochenFlasbarth} :
    \emoexpression[polarity=positive,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,
      sentiment\_ref=1]{Guter} \#Spiegel-Titel ,
    \target[sentiment\_ref=1]{wie Welzer , Sloterdijk und andere Promi
      \#Nichtw\"ahler die Demokratie verspielen : Tr\"age ,
      frustriert}}

  {\scriptsize(\sentiment[polarity=positive,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,id=1]{RT
      \source[sentiment\_ref=1]{@JochenFlasbarth} : A
      \emoexpression[polarity=positive,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,
        sentiment\_ref=1]{good} \#Spiegel title ,
      \target[sentiment\_ref=1]{how Welzer , Sloterdijk, and other
        celebrity non-voters squander the democracy : Sluggish ,
        frustrated}})}
\end{exmp*}

Another sentiment is instantiated by the set of emo-expressions with
negative polarity.  All the words \textit{verspielen} (\textit{to
  squander}), \textit{tr\"age} (\textit{sluggish}), and
\textit{frustriert} (\textit{frustrated}) seemingly relate to the
celebrity non-voters, including \textit{Welzer} and
\textit{Sloterdijk}, and author's attitude to these people is
obviously negative.  So, we mark this phrase as follows:

\begin{exmp*}
  \scriptsize
  \sentiment[{\tiny polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,id=2}]{RT
    \source[sentiment\_ref=2]{@JochenFlasbarth} : Guter
    \#Spiegel-Titel , wie \target[sentiment\_ref=2]{Welzer} ,
    \target[sentiment\_ref=2]{Sloterdijk} und
    \target[sentiment\_ref=2]{andere Promi \#Nichtw\"ahler} die
    Demokratie
    \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,sentiment\_ref=2]{verspielen} :
    \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,sentiment\_ref=2]{Tr\"age}
    ,\\ \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,sentiment\_ref=2]{frustriert}\\
  }

  {\scriptsize(\sentiment[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,id=2]{RT
      \source[sentiment\_ref=2]{@JochenFlasbarth} : A good \#Spiegel
      title , how \target[sentiment\_ref=2]{Welzer} ,
      \target[sentiment\_ref=2]{Sloterdijk}, and
      \target[sentiment\_ref=2]{other celebrity non-voters}
      \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,sentiment\_ref=2]{squander}
      the democracy :
      \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,
        sentiment\_ref=2]{Tr\"age} ,\\
      \emoexpression[polarity=negative,intensity=medium,sarcasm=false,
        sentiment\_ref=2]{frustriert}\\
    })}
\end{exmp*}

In both cases, \textit{@JochenFlasbarth} is the original author of
cited opinion, so we mark it as \texttt{source}.  But since we have
two sentiment relations, we mark this word as \texttt{source} twice
and draw an edge (in our example denoted by attribute
\texttt{sentiment\_ref}) to the respective \texttt{sentiment} markable
in each case.
