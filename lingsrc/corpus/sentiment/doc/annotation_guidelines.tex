\section{Overview}
\subsection{Introduction}

In this assignment, your task is to annotate sentiments in a corpus of
Twitter messages.  We define \emph{sentiments} as polar (either
positive or negative) evaluative opinions about some persons,
subjects, or events.  In this assignment, you have to mark both --
text spans denoting the opinions (\emph{sentiments}) and text spans
denoting the subjects and events being evaluated (\emph{sentiment
  targets}).  Additionally, you should also annotate the holders of
the opinions (\emph{sentiment sources}) and lexical elements which
might significantly influence the polarity and intensity of
sentiments.  The latter elements include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{emotional expressions}, which are words or phrases that
    unequivocally possess some evaluative lexical meaning by
    themselves (these are typically words like \emph{hassen}
    (\emph{hate}), \emph{bewundern} (\emph{admire}), \emph{sch\"on}
    (\emph{nice}) etc.);
  \item \emph{negations}, which are words or expressions that might
    completely flip the polarity of an emotional expression or a
    sentiment to the opposite (e.g. \emph{nicht} gut (\emph{not}
    good), \emph{kein} Talent (\emph{not} a talent) etc.);
  \item \emph{intensifiers} and \emph{diminishers} (or
    \emph{downtoners}) which are words and expressions that might,
    respectively, increase or decrease the evaluative sense of
    emotional expressions.  Examples of intensifiers include words
    like \emph{sehr} (\emph{very}), \emph{besonders}
    (\emph{especially}), \emph{insbesondere} (\emph{particularly})
    etc.  Typical examples of diminishers include words like \emph{ein
      wenig} (\emph{a little}), \emph{ein bisschen} (\emph{a bit}),
    \emph{gewisserma\ss{}en} (\emph{to a certain degree}) etc.
\end{itemize}

After marking these elements, you should also specify the values of
their respective attributes.  A complete list of all elements to be
marked along with the description of their possible attributes is
given in Section \ref{sec:markables}.  In Section \ref{sec:faq}, we
also provide some annotation examples and answer some questions which
caused special difficulties during the previous annotation runs.

\subsection{Terminology and Format}
\textbf{Terminology.} Throughout this document, we will use the term
\emph{markable} to denote an annotated span of text.  The term
\emph{markable type} (or \emph{markable tag}) will refer to the tag
assigned to a markable.  Additional attributes associated with the
annotated text spans will be called \emph{markable attributes}.

We will not make a distinction between the terms \emph{opinions} and
\emph{sentiments} and will use both words interchangeably unless the
latter refers to the type of a markable.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Format.} In these guidelines, we rely
on the following conventions regarding the formatting of text.

We specify shell commands in gray boxes in \texttt{typesetting} font
as shown in the example below: \code{echo 'Hello world!'}  The
\texttt{typesetting} font is also used for literal mentions of
markable types, markable attributes, file names, directory paths, and
executable commands.

Examples of words and phrases are given in \textit{italics} and their
respective English translation is provided in parentheses.

Examples of sentence annotations are shown in regular font. Text
belonging to markables is \emph{emphasized} and surrounded by square
brackets (e.g. [\emph{markable text}]).  The type of the markables is
given as a subscript after the closing right bracket; optional
markable attributes are specified after the type, separated from it by
a colon, e.g.:
\begin{exmp}
  \sentiment[polarity=positive]{\target{Der neue Papst} gilt als
    \emoexpression{bescheidener}, \emoexpression{zur\"uckgenommener}
    Typ}.

{\footnotesize(\sentiment[polarity=positive]{\target{The new Pope} is
    believed to be a \emoexpression{sober}, \emoexpression{modest}
    man}.)}\label{exmpl:1}
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Annotation Tool}

For annotating text, you should use \texttt{MMAX2} -- a freely
available annotation tool -- which you can download under the
following link:

{\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}\small\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmax2/files/mmax2/mmax2_1.13.003/MMAX2_1.13.003b.zip/download}}

After downloading this file, please unpack the received archive,
change to the newly created directory \texttt{1.13.003/MMAX2} in your
terminal shell and execute the following commands: \code{chmod u+x
  ./mmax2.sh\\ nohup ./mmax2.sh \&} An \texttt{MMAX2} window should
then appear on your screen.  If you have never used \texttt{MMAX2}
before, please read the document \texttt{mmax2quickstart.pdf}, which
you can find in the subdirectory \texttt{MMAX2/Docs} of the downloaded
archive.

\subsection{Corpus Files}

You should also have received a copy of corpus files either as a
tar-gzipped archive or via the version control system \texttt{Git}.

If you got a \texttt{.tgz} archive of the corpus, then unpack it using
the command: \code{tar -xzf archive-name.tgz} After that, a directory
called \corpusDir{} should appear in your current folder.

If you received access to the \texttt{Git} repository of the project,
you should clone the project to your local computer with the command:
\code{git clone repository-address path-to-trg-dir} Then, you should
find folders called \texttt{annotator-*} in the directory
\texttt{path-to-trg-dir/lingsrc/ corpus/}\corpusDir{}.

In order to load an annotation file into your \texttt{MMAX2} program,
you should change to the \texttt{MMAX2} window and click on the menu
\texttt{File -> Load}.  In the displayed popup window, select the path
to the newly created \corpusDir{}\texttt{/anno\-ta\-tor-x}
folder\footnote{Please, make sure that the path to the \corpusDir{}
  folder does not contain any white spaces.  Otherwise, \texttt{MMAX2}
  might fail to load the project.}, where \texttt{x} is the annotator
number that was assigned to you, and click on one of the
\texttt{*.mmax} files found there.  The chosen project should then be
loaded into your \texttt{MMAX2} editor.

If you have any difficulties with launching \texttt{MMAX2} or loading
the project files into your editor, please contact the author of these
guidelines via e-mail (\authorAddress{}).

\section{Tags and Attributes}\label{sec:markables}
In the following, we provide a short list of all markables and their
possible attributes that will be used in this annotation task:

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{sentiment}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{polarity},
    \item \texttt{intensity},
    \item \texttt{sarcasm};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{target}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{preferred},
    \item \texttt{anaph-ref},
    \item \texttt{sentiment-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{source}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{anaph-ref},
    \item \texttt{sentiment-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{emo-expression}-markable with the attributes:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{polarity},
    \item \texttt{intensity},
    \item \texttt{sarcasm},
    \item \texttt{sentiment-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{intensifier}-markable with the attributes:

    \item \texttt{degree},
    \item \texttt{emo-expression-ref};
    \end{enumerate}
  \item and, finally, the \texttt{negation}-markable with the
    attribute:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{emo-expression-ref}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent{}A more detailed description o these markables and the
values of their respective attributes is given below.

\subsection{sentiment}\label{sec:sentiment}
With the \texttt{sentiment} tags, you should mark polar evaluative
opinions about people, subjects or events.  Typical examples of
sentiment statements are sentences like the following one:
\begin{exmp}
  \sentiment{Ich mag den neuen James Bond Film nicht}.

  (\sentiment{I don't like the new James Bond
    movie}.)\label{ex:sentiment}
\end{exmp}

According to our defintion, a sentiment must always fulfill the
following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item it should be \textbf{subjective}, i.e. you should not mark as
  \texttt{sentiment}s mere statements of facts like, for example,
  \textit{Beim Angriff wurden 14 Glasscheiben besch\"adigt}
  (\textit{14 glass plates were broken during the attack}); there
  should always be a personal opionion of the author or some person or
  institution being cited;

\item it should be \textbf{polar}, i.e. a sentiment should always
  reflect either positive or negative attitude to its respective
  target.  Cases like \textit{Ich glaube, er wird heute fr\"uher
    kommen} (\textit{I think he will be earlier today}) should not be
  marked as sentiments because the attitutde of the author is unclear;

\item it should be \textbf{evaluative}, which means that a sentiment
  should always refer to an explicit target.  You should not mark as
  sentiments cases like \textit{Ich bin heute so gl\"ucklich}
  (\textit{I am so happy today}), because these statements do not
  evaluate anything particular.
\end{itemize}

You should not mark as sentiments polar opinions whose validity status
is unknown.  This includes cases like \textit{Ich wei\ss{} nicht, ob
  ich meinen Bruder mag} (\textit{I don't know if I like my brother})
which should not be enclosed in the \texttt{sentiment} tags because
neither we nor the author actually know if the author likes or
dislikes her brother.  Exceptions from these are cases like
\textit{Ich zweifle, dass er ein guter Mensch ist} (\textit{I doubt
  that he is a good man}) or \textit{Ich glaube nicht, dass er diesen
  Preis verdient hat} (\textit{I don't think that he has deserved this
  award}) which act as negations and express a negative attitude.
Special care should be taken when dealing with irrealis and
interrogative clauses (cf. Examples \ref{exmp:irrealis-1},
\ref{exmp:irrealis-2}, and \ref{exmp:interrog} in the
\nameref{sec:faq} Section of this document).

We also consider comparisons to be a special type of sentiments.  But
in contrast to regular evaluative opinions, comparisons typically
express a relative polarity, i.e. an object is regarded to be either
better or worse than another compared object, but we usually do not
know if the author actually likes or dislikes any of them.  So,
comparisons should also be marked with the \texttt{sentiment} tags,
but you should set the value of their \texttt{polarity} attribute to
the special type \texttt{comparison}.

When determining the boundaries of a \texttt{sentiment} span, you
should always enclose in the \texttt{sentiment} tags \emph{the minimal
  complete syntactic or discourse-level units that express an
  evaluative opinion}.  A sentiment unit should simultaneously
encompass the subject being evaluated (the target) and the actual
expression which is showing sentiment's attitude .  This is typically
done by a single noun or verb phrase (syntactic units) or by means of
one or multiple sentences (discourse-level units).  Minimal, in this
case, means that if both target and evaluative expression are
expressed within a single noun phrase, you should not include any
parent elements of this phrase in the markable.  Complete means that
if a sentiment is expressed by a single verb phrase, for example; then
you should enclose this verb phrase in the \texttt{sentiment} tags but
you should not mark any of its syntactic parents unless they are also
immediately related to the evaluative opinion being expressed.

Below we give a couple of annotation examples for sentiments together
with explanations.
\begin{exmp}
  Auf dem Tisch lag \sentiment{ein langweiliges Buch}.

  (There was \sentiment{a boring book} on the table.)\label{exmp:book}
\end{exmp}

In Example \ref{exmp:book}, you can see a personal, negative statement
made about a book.  This opinion is subjective (since it expresses a
personal judgement of the author), polar (because this statement is
judging negatively), and evaluative (as the judgement is made about
the book).  So, this opinion should be definitely marked as a
\texttt{sentiment}.  Next, we look at the syntactic and discourse
constituents by which this sentiment is expressed.  Both target
(\textit{book}) and evaluative expression (\textit{boring}) occur in a
single noun phrase (\textit{a boring book}), so we mark this noun
phrase completely including the indefinite article but we do not mark
anything else except for this phrase since other information are
unrelated to the judgement.

\begin{exmp}
  Wir akzeptieren das, weil \sentiment{wir alle ein bisschen in
    Petterson verliebt sind}.

  (We accept this because \sentiment{we all are a little bit in love
    with Petterson}.)\label{exmp:petterson}
\end{exmp}

In Example \ref{exmp:petterson}, the evaluative statement is made
about \textit{Petterson}.  The author says that they all \textit{in
  ihn verliebt sind} (\textit{are in love with him}) which is her
subjective positive opinion.  The target of this sentiment is
\textit{Petterson}, the evaluative expression is \textit{verliebt sein
  in} (\textit{to be in love with}) which both are included in the
verb phrase with the head verb \textit{be}.  So, we mark the whole
verb phrase including the subject \textit{wir} (\textit{we}).

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item single noun phrases, possibly with their prepositional
%%   attributes, e.g. \textit{Auf dem Tisch lag \sentiment{ ein
%%       langweiliges Buch} (There was \sentiment{a boring book} on the
%%     table)};
%% \item clauses, e.g. \textit{\sentiment{Ich hasse B\"ucher ohne
%%   Inhaltsangabe}. (\sentiment{I hate books without table of
%%   contents})};
%% \item multiple sentences in cases when these sentences jointly form a
%%   sentiment relation, e.g.\\\textit{\sentiment{Sie denken, reden,
%%       riechen, lieben, schmecken, f*cken Plastik. Sie haben\\das so
%%       gelernt in der Plastik-Werbewelt}.\\ (\sentiment{They think and
%%       speak about, smell at, love, taste, f*ck plastic.  They
%%       have\\ learned it so in the advertising world of plastic}.)}.
%% \end{itemize}

After you have marked the \texttt{sentiment} span, you should next set
the values of its attributes.  Acceptable attributes, their meaning
and values are given in Table \ref{tbl:sentiment}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{sentiment} markables.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline
      Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      & \textit{positive} & sentiment expresses positive attitude about
      its respective target, e.g. \textit{Es war ein fantastischer Abend
        (It was a fantastic evening)};\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{negative\newline(default)} & sentiment expresses
      negative attitude about its respective target, e.g. \textit{Seine
        Schwester ist einfach unausstehlich (His sister is simply
        obnoxious)}\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-3}{*}{polarity} & \textit{comparison} & sentiment
      expresses a comparison of two objects with preference given to one
      of them, e.g. \textit{Mir gef\"allt das rote Kleid mehr als das
        blaue (I like the red dress more than the blue one)}\\\hline

      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      & \textit{weak} & sentiment expresses a weak evaluative opinion,
      e.g. \textit{Der Auftritt war mehr oder weniger gut (The
        appearance was more or less good)}\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{medium\newline(default)} & sentiment has a middle
      emotional expressivity, e.g. \textit{Mir hat das neue Album gut
        gefallen (I enjoyed the new album)}\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-3}{*}{intensity} & \textit{strong} & this sentiment
      expresses a very emotional polar statement, e.g. \textit{Dieses
        Festival war einfach umwerfend!!! (This festival was simply
        terrific!!!)}\\\hline
      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      \multirow{2}{*}{sarcasm} & \textit{true} & this polar attitude is
      derisive, i.e. its actual polarity is the opposite of its apparent
      form. (An apparent praise, for example, could be meant as a rebuke
      and vice versa. The actual sense, however, can only be inferred on
      the basis of world knowledge or reasoning.)  An example of a
      sarcastic sentiment is the following passage: \textit{Mein
        J\"ungerer ist in der Pr\"ufung durchgefallen.  Klasse! (My
        youngest has failed his exam.  Well done!)}  In this case, you
      should set the polarity attribute of the sentiment to
      \texttt{negative} and the value of the \texttt{sarcasm} attribute
      to \textit{true}.\\\cline{2-3}

      & \textit{false\newline(default)} & no sarcasm is present -- the
      polar attitude has its literal meaning; this is the default.
      setting\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:sentiment}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{target}
With the \texttt{target} tags, you should mark objects or events which
are being evaluated by sentiment expressions.  There must always be at
least one target element for one sentiment relation.  An example of a
sentiment target is given in the following sentence:
\begin{exmp}
Mein Bruder ist nicht begeistert von \target{dem neuen Call of Duty}.

(My brother is not impressed by \target{the new Call of Duty}.)
\end{exmp}

As for sentiments, you should always mark with the \texttt{target}
tags minimal complete syntactic or discourse-level units which denote
evaluated events or objects.  These are usually expressed by noun
phrases (e.g. \textit{Mir wird's schlecht, wenn ich \target{diese
    Werbung} im Fernsehen sehe} (\textit{I feel sick when I see this
  \target{ad} on TV})) or complete verb phrases (clauses)
(e.g. \textit{Ich hasse es wenn \target{Voldemort mein Shampoo
    benutzt.}} (\textit{I hate it when \target{Voldemort is using my
    shampoo}})).

If one sentiment has multiple targets which are conjoined by commas or
coordinative conjunctions, you should mark each of these targets
separately (cf. Example \ref{exmp:trg-conj}).
\begin{exmp}
  Meiner Mutter haben immer \target{Nelken} und \target{Dahlien}
  gefallen.

  (My mother has always liked \target{carnations} and
  \target{dahlias}.)\label{exmp:trg-conj}
\end{exmp}

In cases, when sentiment is a comparison, you should mark each of the
compared objects with separate tags.  Additionally, for the object
which is being dispreferred in the comparison, you should also set the
\textit{preferred} attribute of that \texttt{target} to
\textit{false}:
\begin{exmp}
  Ich mag \target{Domino-Eis} mehr als
  \target[preferred=false]{Magnum}.

  (I like the \target{Domino ice cream} more than
  \target[preferred=false]{Magnum}.)
\end{exmp}

Possible attributes and attribute values for the \texttt{target} tag
are listed in Table \ref{tbl:target}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Attributes and values of \texttt{target} markables.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline
      Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline

      & \textit{true} (default) & in comparisons, this value means that
      the respective target is being considered better than another
      compared object, e.g. \textit{\emph{Die neue Frisur} passt ihr
        garantiert besser als die alte (\emph{The new hairstyle} suits
        her definitely better than the old one)};\\\cline{2-3}

      \multirow{-2}{*}{preferred} & \textit{false} & in comparisons,
      this value marks the target element which is being considered
      worse than its counterpart, e.g. \textit{Die zweite Saison von
        Breaking Bad war viel spannender als \emph{die dritte} (The
        second season of Breaking Bad was much more exciting than
        \emph{the third one})};\\\hline

      sentiment-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
        edge)} & directed edge pointing from \texttt{target} to its
      respective \texttt{sentiment}.  You need to draw this edge in
      two cases:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item when the \texttt{target} is located at intersection of two
        different \texttt{sentiment}s (in this case, you should draw
        an edge from \texttt{target} to \texttt{sentiment}, which this
        \texttt{target} actually belongs to),

      \item when the target of an opinion is expressed outside the
        \texttt{sentiment} span;
      \end{itemize}\\\hline

      anaph-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed edge)} &
      directed edge pointing from \texttt{target} expressed by a
      pronoun or pronominal adverb to its respective non-pronomial
      antecedent (in order to draw this edge, you also need to mark
      the antecedent as \textt{target})\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:target}
  \end{table}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Source
\subsection{source}
The \texttt{source} tag is used to mark the immediate author(s) or
holder(s) of a sentiment opinion.  These are usually speakers or
writers of an assessment or persons whose evaluative attitude is being
cited.  In cases, when the sentiment source is not explicitly present
in the message, it is implicitly assumed to be the author of the
tweet.

An example of a \texttt{source} expression is the pronoun \textit{Sie
  (she)} in the following sentence:
\begin{exmp}
  \source{Sie} mag die neue Farbe nicht

  (\source{She} doesn't like the new color)
\end{exmp}

%% You should usually mark the source element after you have determined
%% and annotated the sentiment relation and its target.  The source
%% should denote the immediate author or holder of the determined
%% sentiment opinion.
In case of citations, only the person or institution, who originally
expressed the assessment, should be marked as \texttt{source} (see
Example \ref{ex:source-requote}).
\begin{exmp}
  Laut Staatsanwalt soll die \source{Angeklagte} sich missbilligend \"uber
  ihren Vorgesetzten ge\"au\ss{}ert haben.

  (According to the attorney, the \source{defendant} had made disapproving
  remarks about her boss.)\label{ex:source-requote}
\end{exmp}
The citing persons should not be considered as sources unless it is
explicitly stated that they also share the opinion they cite.

A \texttt{source} tag can usually include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pronouns, e.g. \textit{\source{Er} genoss die Aussicht von
    seinem Balkon (\source{He } enjoyed the view from his balcony)}.
    In this case, you should also draw an edge from the pronoun to its
    respective antecedent if this antecedent can be observed in the
    immediate context (see the \texttt{anaph-ref} attribute in Table
    \ref{tbl-target});

  \item Noun phrases formed by nouns and their attributes,
    e.g. \textit{\source{Sein Onkel} regte sich \"uber die neuen
      Steuern auf (\source{His uncle} got worked up over the new
      taxes)};
\end{itemize}
In cases, when the source of a sentiment is expressed by multiple
coordinatively joined independent noun phrases, you should mark each such noun
phrase with a separate \texttt{source} tag, e.g.:
\begin{exmp}\label{ex:2source}
  \source{Ihr} und \source{ihrer Mutter} gef\"allt die neue Farbe
  nicht.\\ (\source{She} and \source{her mother} do not like the new
  color)
\end{exmp}

The attributes of the \texttt{source} tag are listed in Table
\ref{tbl-source}.  The meaning of these attributes is fully identical
to the meaning of the corresponding attributes for \texttt{target}s.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline
    Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline\label{tbl-source}

    sentiment-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed edge)}
    & see Table \ref{tbl-target}\\\hline

    anaph-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed edge)} &
    see Table \ref{tbl-target}\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Emo-expression
\subsection{emo-expression}
With the \texttt{emo-expression} tag, you should mark words and
phrases that have some polar subjective sense in their lexical
meaning.  A possible example of an emo-expression is the word
\textit{ekelhaft} (\textit{disgusting}) the sentence below:
\begin{exmp}
  Beim Aufr\"aumen des Zimmers haben wir einen
  \emoexpression{ekelhaften } Teller mit verschimmeltem Essen unter
  dem Bett gefunden.

  (When we cleaned the room, we found a \emoexpression{disgusting}
  plate of moldy food under the bed.)
\end{exmp}

Emotional expressions must always be marked regardless of whether a
sentiment is present or not. This is in contrast to sources and
targets which should only be annotated in the context of a sentiment
relation.

Please note, that due to lexical ambiguity, it can also sometimes
happen that the same word or expression, that appears to have an
emotional lexical sense in one context, will have a neutral meaning in
another.  You should mark an element as an \texttt{emo-expression}
only in the former case, i.e. when its immediately activated sense in
the given text is evaluative (see the following examples):
\begin{exmp}
  Dieser Wein ist ein echtes \emoexpression{Juwel} in meiner
  Kollektion.

  This wine is a real \emoexpression{jewel} in my collection.
\end{exmp}
\begin{exmp}
  Koh-i-Noor ist das teuerste Juwel heutzutage.

  Koh-i-Noor is the most expensive jewel nowadays.
\end{exmp}
In the first example, the meaning of \textit{Juwel (jewel)} is
metaphoric and only this metaphoric sense has a polar connotation.  In
the second example, the meaning of \textit{Juwel (jewel)} is literal
and does not express any appraisal.

The \texttt{emo-expression}s are usually represented by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item nouns, e.g. \textit{Held (hero)}, \textit{Ideal (ideal)},
    \textit{Betr\"uger (fraudster)} etc.;

  \item adjectives or adverbs, e.g. \textit{sch\"on (nice)},
    \textit{zuverl\"assig (reliably)}, \textit{hinterh\"altig
      (devious)}, \textit{heimt\"uckisch (insidiously)} etc.;

  \item verbs, e.g. \textit{lieben (to love)}, \textit{bewundern (to
    admire)}, \textit{hassen (to hate)} etc.;

  \item idioms, e.g. \textit{auf die Nerven gehen (to get on one's
    nerves)} etc.;

  \item smileys, e.g. :), :-(, \smiley{}, \frownie{} etc.;
\end{itemize}
This list is however neither complete nor limited.

The \texttt{emo-expression} elements can accept the following
attributes with the following possible values:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline\label{tbl-emo}
    Attribute & Value & Value's Meaning\\\hline
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    & \textit{positive} & the given emotional expression has a
    positive appraising meaning, e.g. \textit{gut (good), verhimmeln
      (to ensky), Prachtkerl (corker)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

    \multirow{-2}{*}{polarity} & \textit{negative\newline(default)} &
    the given emotional expression has a negative polar sense,
    e.g. \textit{versauen (to botch up), rotzig (snotty), Dreckskerl
      (scum)} etc.\\\hline

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    & \textit{weak} & the given emo-expression has a weak appraising
    sense, e.g. \textit{solala (so-so), nullachtf\"unfzehn (vanilla),
      durchschnittlich (mediocre)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

    & \textit{medium\newline(default)} & the given emo-expression has
    a regular appraising sense and middle stylistic expressivity,
    e.g. \textit{gut (good), schlecht (bad), robust (tough)}
    etc.\\\cline{2-3}

    \multirow{-3}{*}{intensity} & \textit{strong} & the given
    emo-expression forms a very strong positive or negative
    assessment, e.g. \textit{allerbeste (bettermost), zum Kotzen (to
      make one puke), Kacke (shit)} etc.\\\hline

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    sentiment-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed edge)}
    & This attribute has the same meaning as its equivalents for
    targets and sources.  In ambiguous usage cases, it should show to
    which sentiment the given emo-expression belongs.  Just like for
    targets, a usage case should be considered ambiguous if this
    expression is located in the intersection of two sentiment spans
    or if it is expressed outside of any marked sentiment relation but
    has an immediate relation to it.  If an emo-expression does not
    belong to any sentiment or if it is unambigously embedded in just
    one sentiment relation, this attribute edge needs not to be
    drawn.\\\hline

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \multirow{2}{*}{sarcasm} & \textit{true} & the given emo-expression is
    derisive, i.e. its actual polarity is the opposite of its apparent
    form. (This means that an apparent praise which appears in text is
    in fact meant as a rebuke and vice versa. The actual sense,
    however, can only be inferred on the basis of world knowledge or
    reasoning.)\\\cline{2-3}

    & \textit{false\newline(default)} & no sarcasm is present -- the
    polar attitude has its literal meaning; this is the default
    setting\\\hline
    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


When determining the polarity of an emotional expression, you should keep in
mind the following two aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The annotated polarity of an \texttt{emo-expression} should be
    its \textit{prior} (or sometimes also called \textit{lexical})
    polarity.  This type of polarity is the polar sense of a word or
    expression, independent of its possible contextual changes.  In
    simple words, this usually means that you should disregard any
    negations when determining and setting the value of the polarity
    attribute for an \texttt{emo-expression}. So, for example, in the
    sentence \textit{Es war keine gute Idee (It was not a good idea)},
    the polarity of the \texttt{emo-expression} \textit{gute (good)}
    should still be positive despite the fact that in the end, this
    polarity is negated;

  \item Some emo-expressions can have an asymmetric polarity for their
    arguments.  A typical example of such an expression is the word
    \textit{vermissen (miss)}.  If we say that \textit{Alice vermisst
      Bob (Alice misses Bob)}, it usually means something negative for
    Alice (because she experiences a discomfort feeling) but at the
    same time something positive for Bob (because it is implied that
    Alice would be happier if he joined her).  In these cases, if one
    of the arguments is the sentiment's target, you should determine
    the polarity of the emo-expression from the perspective of the
    target.  So, in this case, the target of the sentiment is
    \textit{Bob} (it is his absence which is being assessed) and the
    polarity of the emo-expression \textit{vermissen (miss)} should
    therefore be positive.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Intensifier
\subsection{intensifier}
Intensifiers are elements which increase the stylistic expressivity
and the polar sense of an emotional expression.  An example of
intensifier is the word \textit{sehr (very)} in the following example:
\begin{exmp}
  wir suchen eine \intensifier{sehr} zuverl\"assige Polin als
  Haushaltshilfe.

  (we are looking for a \intensifier{very} reliable Polish woman as
  domestic help.)
\end{exmp}
An intensifier should always relate to an emo-expression and you
should always explicitly show this relation by drawing an attribute
edge from the intensifier to the respective expression whose sense is
being intensified (see the \texttt{emo-expression-ref} attribute in
Table \ref{tbl-intens}).

Intensifiers are usually expressed by adverbs or adjectives like
\textit{sehr (very), sicherlich (certainly)} etc.  Other ways of
expressing these elements are still possible, though.

The intensifier elements can have the following attributes with the
following possible values:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline\label{tbl-intens}

    & \textit{medium (default)} & the intensifier moderately increases
    the polar sense of the emotional expression, e.g. \textit{ziemlich
      (quite), recht (fairly)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

    \multirow{-2}{*}{degree} & \textit{strong} & the intensifier
    strongly increases the polar sense and stylistic markedness of the
    emotional expression, e.g. \textit{sehr (very), super (super),
      stark (strongly)} etc.\\\hline

    %%%%%%

    emo-expression-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
      edge)} & a directed edge pointing from the intensifier to the
    \texttt{emo-expression} whose meaning is being intensified\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{diminisher}
With the \texttt{diminisher} tag, you should mark elements that
decrease the polar lexical sense of an emotional expression.  In
Example \ref{ex:diminisher}, you can see one possible usage of a
diminisher:
\begin{exmp}
  \diminisher{Weniger} erfolgreiche Unternehmen verzichten auf externe
  Berater.\label{ex:diminisher}

  The \diminisher{less} successful companies do not use external
  consultants.
\end{exmp}
Just like intensifiers, diminishers should always relate to some emotional
expression and you should always explicitly show this relation by drawing the
attribute edge \texttt{emo-expression-ref} (see Table \ref{tbl-intens}).

Also like intensifieres, diminishers are usually expressed by
adjectives or adverbs, e.g. \textit{wenig (few), kaum (hardly), ein
  bisschen (little)}.  But other means of expressing these elements
are possible too.

Diminishers have the same set of attributes as intensifiers with the only
difference in the interpretation of the \textit{degree} attribute:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline\label{tbl-dimin}

    & \textit{medium (default)} & the given diminisher moderately
    decreases the polar sense of its respective emotional expression,
    e.g. \textit{wenig (few), bisschen (little)} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

    \multirow{-2}{*}{degree} & \textit{strong} & the given diminisher
    strongly decreases the polar sense of the emotional expression,
    e.g. \textit{kaum (hardly)} etc.\\\hline

    emo-expression-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
      edge)} & see Table \ref{tbl-intens}\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{negation}
With the \texttt{negation} tag, you should mark elements which turn
the polarity of a sentiment relation to its complete opposite.  For
example, in the following sentence, the negative article \textit{kein
  (not)} renders the sentiment's polarity negative, but without this
article, it would have been positive:
\begin{exmp}
Einstein war \negation{kein} kluger Mensch!\label{ex:negation}

Einstein was \negation{not} a clever person!
\end{exmp}

The role and the meaning of negations are closely related to that of
the diminishers.  In order to help you better differentiate between
these two elements, we have listed the most obvious differences
between the classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item\textit{Semantic differences}.  While diminishers still allow
    for some portion of the original meaning of an emo-expression to
    remain (\textit{a hardly understandable speech} is still
    understandable), negations fully deny this meaning and change it
    to a completely antonymous one (\textit{a not understandable
      speech} is completely unintelligible);

  \item\textit{Part-of-speech differences}.  While diminishers are usually
    expressed by either adjectives or adverbs; negations, on the contrary, are
    commonly represented by either the negative article \textit{kein (no)} or
    the negation particle \textit{nicht (not)}, or complete clauses, e.g.
    \textit{Es ist sehr zweifelhaft, dass die neue Version von Windows besser
      wird (It is very doubtful that the new Windows version will be any
      better)}.

  %% \item\textit{Syntactic differences}.  While diminishers are usually
  %%   expressed by either adjectives or adverbs; negations, on the contrary,
  %%   are commonly represented by either the negative article \textit{kein
  %%   (no)} or the negation particle \textit{nicht (not)}, or even complete
  %%   clauses (\textit{Er ist nicht einverstanden, dass die neue Version von
  %%   Windows besser ist (He disagrees that the new Windows version is any
  %%   better)}).
\end{itemize}
All three elements -- diminishers, intensifiers, and negations --
should only be annotated in the presence of an \texttt{emo-expression}
or a \texttt{sentiment}.  If neither the former nor the latter is
present in the text message, you should not annotate these elements
too.

As already mentioned, negations can usually be expressed by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the negative article \textit{kein (no)}, e.g. \textit{Es war keine
    Vergn\"ugungsreise f\"ur australische Machthaber (It was no pleasure trip
    for some of Australia's most powerful leaders)};
  \item the negation particle \textit{nicht (not)}, e.g. \textit{Er hat seine
    Studienzeit ganz und gar nicht genossen (He did not enjoy his college days
    at all)};
  \item clauses, e.g. \textit{Es ist absolut unm\"oglich, dass aus ihm am Ende
    noch ein guter Mensch wird (It is absolutely impossible that he will
    eventually become a good man)}.
\end{itemize}

Like diminishers and intensifiers, negations also can have the pointer
attribute \texttt{emo-expression-ref} (see Table \ref{tbl-negation}).
You should draw this edge in cases when you can clearly indentify
which \texttt{emo-expression} is being negated by a negation.  In
cases, when you can identify a sentiment and a negation but no
emotional expression is present, you must not draw this edge.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline\label{tbl-negation}
    emo-expression-ref & \textit{$\longrightarrow$\newline(directed
      edge)} & an edge from the negation to the
    \texttt{emo-expression} being negated\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:summary}
To summarize, your task in this assignment is to find subjective
appraising opinions, that judge about some particular things or events
from a personal perspective.  You should annotate these assessments as
\texttt{sentiment}s, determine whether the judgements they represent
are negative or positive, and also decide how strong the judgements
are.  Next, you should separately mark the objects being assessed as
sentiment \texttt{target}s.  The authors of the opinions (or the
persons whose appraising opinions are being cited) should be marked as
sentiment \texttt{source}s.  Both, sources and targets should only be
marked if a sentiment relation is present in message.

Another important task is to annotate lexical expressions whose
meaning contains some polar assessing sense.  These elements are
called \texttt{emo-expression}s and they should always be annotated
regardless of whether a sentiment relation is present or not.  In case
when an emo-expression is being intensified, diminished, or negated by
some elements, you should also annotate these modifying elements as
\texttt{intensifier}, \texttt{diminisher}, and \texttt{negation},
respectively.

\section{FAQ}\label{sec:faq}
This section provides possible solutions to some difficult and
controversial annotation cases.  Please read through this list
carefully before starting to annotate.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate as sentiments cases like
  \textit{einer Sache zustimmen (to agree with sth.)}, \textit{sich
    f\"ur etwas entscheiden (to opt for sth.)}, \textit{jemandem
    etwas vorwerfen (to accuse so. of sth.)} or \textit{etwas
    unterst\"utzen (to support sth.)}?}

  \textbf{A:} Well, these cases are a little bit tricky and,
  unfortunately, we will not be able to give you a clean and elegant
  solution for them.  We would rather say that both variants,
  i.e. annotating and not annotating sentences with these elements as
  sentiments, would be legitimate.  In fact, after all annotators
  finish their work, we are going to conduct a study on the
  inter-annotator agreement for such expressions and make our final
  decision based on the majority of choices made by different
  annotators.

\item\textbf{Q: How would you annotate the following cases of comparisons?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{\textit{Seehofer hat die Gr\"unen ausgeschlossen , aber
      die Linke nicht (Seehofer has excluded the Greens, but not the
      Left)}};

    \textbf{A:} Without any further context, I cannot see any
    sentiment relation here.  So, I would probably not annotate
    anything;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Lieber starke Mitte statt linker Rand (Better
      strong middle than left edge)}};

    \textbf{A:} Comparison with \textit{starke Mitte (strong middle)}
    as preferred target, and \textit{linker Rand (left edge)} as
    dispreferred one;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Die \#spd wird lieber mit den rechten von \#cdu
      , \#csu koalieren als mit der \#linke (The \#spd will better for
      a coalition with the rightists from \#cdu, \#csu than with the
      \#left)}};

    \textbf{A:} Comparison, with \textit{\#spd} as source,
    \textit{\#cdu} and \textit{\#csu} preferred targets, and
    \textit{\#linke (\#left)} as dispreferred one;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Die \#AfD + vereinigt mehr \"okonomische
      Kompetenz als alle etabl. Parteien + Bunde... (The \#AfD +
      combines more economic expertise than all established parties +
      federal...)}};

    \textbf{A:} Comparison, with \textit{\#AFD} as preferred target
    and \textit{established parties} and \textit{federal} as
    dispreferred ones;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Freiheit statt Bevormundung (Freedom instead of
      paternalism)}};

    \textbf{A:} Comparison, with \textit{Freiheit (freedom)} as
    preferred target, and \textit{Bevormundung (paternalism)} as
    dispreferred one;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Fettarme Milch hat mittlerweile mehr Prozent
      wie die FDP (lowfat milk has meanwhile more percents than the
      FDP)}};

    \textbf{A:} I'd rather say that this is sarcasm about the FDP.
    Because we usually cannot compare a bottle of milk with a
    political party.  If we do so then usually with the purpose of
    tutting at this party;

  \item\textbf{\textit{Was ist der Unterschied zwischen einem Smart
      und der FDP ? Der Smart hat wenigstens 2 Sitze :) (What is the
      difference between a Smart and the FDP? The Smart has at least
      two seats)}};

    \textbf{A:} The same as the previous question -- sarcasm about the
    FDP;
  \end{itemize}

\item\textbf{Q: How can I determine the intensity of a comparison?}

  \textbf{A:} Well, comparisons are, in fact, assessments too.  But in
  contrast to other sentiment relations, these assessments are
  relative rather than absolute.  It means that we do not claim that
  something is bad or good, but we just say that something is worse or
  better than something else.  The more vivid this difference between
  two compared objects is, the higher is the intensity of the
  comparison.  So, if we find \textit{this lousy Telekom waaaaaay less
    reliable than O2}, then the intensity should probably be higher
  than in \textit{Telekom has a less reliable connection than 02}.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in recommendations?}

  \textbf{A:} Usually yes.  If this recommendation represents a
  personal opinion and is not a spam, and you can unambiguously
  determine the target of this opinion, then you should annotate
  sentiment here.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in defenses?}

  \textbf{A:} Usually not.  If a soldier defends his position or a PhD
  student defends her thesis, it does not necessarily imply that he or
  she likes it.  The same is true in cases when someone defenses
  another person in a dispute.

\item\textbf{Q: Should I annotate sentiments in questions?}

  \textbf{A:} Well, it primarily depends on the type of the question.
  Here, you should distinguish two cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If it is a \textit{yes-no-question}, which asks whether a
      particular sentiment opinion is true or not, you should not
      annotate any sentiment relation in such sentence.  For example,
      in \textit{Gef\"allt dir der neue Rock?  (Do you like the new
        skirt?)}, we do not know whether the asked person likes or
      dislikes the new skirt, thus we should not annotate a sentiment
      in this case;
    \item If it is a \textit{wh-question}, which asks about the
      reasons or some other aspects of a polar opinion but does not
      raise the truth of this opinion to question, the sentiment
      relation should be marked.  For example, in \textit{Warum hasst
        du deine Schwester? (Why do you hate your sister?)}, the fact
      that someone hates her sister is not in doubt and we should
      annotate sentiment in this sentence.
  \end{itemize}

\item\textbf{Q: When should I mark sentiments in irrealis sentences?}
  \begin{exmp}
    TODO: add an example
  \label{exmp:irrealis-1}
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
    TODO: add an example
  \label{exmp:irrealis-2}
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
    TODO: add an example
  \label{exmp:interrog}
\end{exmp}

\item\textbf{Q: Should I mark sentiments in insults?}

  \textbf{A:} If you can locate the target, then yes.  For example, in
  \textit{Du bist ein Idiot! (You are an idiot!)}, \textit{Du (You)}
  is the target of a negative sentiment relation.  On the contrary, in
  cases like \textit{Idiot!  (Idiot!)}, no target is detectable and
  therefore, according to our definition, no sentiment can exist.

\item\textbf{Q: Is it possible that sources and targets are expressed
  by other means than the ones described in these guidelines?}

  \textbf{A:} Yes. These guidelines are in no way exhaustive, they
  should just give you a better sense of how a typical source or
  target usually might look like.

\item\textbf{Q: It is said that we should disregard negations when
  determining the polarity of an emo-expression.  What about
  sentiments, shall we take into account negations there?}

  \textbf{A:} Yes.  The polarity of an emo-expression represents the
  polar sense of a single lexical item.  The polarity of a sentiment,
  on the contrary, should show the joint sense of the whole phrase,
  which forms a sentiment relation, so you should take into account
  negations there.

\item\textbf{Q: How should I annotate chains of
  intensifiers/diminishers -- each separately or the whole chain with
  one tag?}

  \textbf{A:} In case of multiple intensifiers/diminishers, each
  element should be tagged separately, e.g. \textit{Du bist die
    '\intensifier{aller} \intensifier{aller}' Beste! (You are the
    \intensifier{very} \intensifier{very} best!)}

\item\textbf{Q: What is the target in, for example, \textit{a really nice weekend}. 
	The whole phrase?}

  \textbf{A:} No it is not the whole phrase but only \textit{weekend}. \textit{really} 
	is an intensifier and \textit{nice} is an emo-expression.

%% \item F: Dem Tweet aus politics1 ``Wo ist der \#Jubel von \#CDU \#CSU

\end{document}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{sentiment}
\begin{itemize}
\item I have difficulties determining the overall sentiment of a tweet.  Is
  there a common modus operandi?

Please keep in mind that sentiments should always be annotated
target-oriented. Look at this tweet: \textit{Ich hab Maria ja schon so
  vermisst und so , ne ? (I kind of did miss Maria, right?)}. Here you
might think the tweet has a negative sentiment, because the author
missed Maria which is not a good thing. But we are always only
concerned about the sentiment relation between the source and the
target! And here it is a positive sentiment, because the author missed
Maria because he likes her.

\item How to annotate sarcasm?

If the apparent form of a sentiment is positive (and therefore should
be annotated as a positive sentiment) but you can detect sarcasm
please annotate the polarity as negative and additionally set
\texttt{sarcasm} to \texttt{true} in the attribute window. This
applies to the sentiment tag as well as to emo-expressions.

\item Should subjunctives be annotated?

Yes. Have a look on the following tweet: \textit{W\"are toll wenn das
  der n\"achste " Call of Duty " - Teil sein w\"urde , liebe
  @GameStar. (Dear @gamestar, it would be great if this would be the
  sequel of "Call of Duty".)}. Although this is a subjunctive
sentiment and is not "reality" right now you should annotate this,
too.

\item Should multiple sentiment layers be annotated?

Yes. For example in the tweet \textit{72 j\"ahriger Leser regt sich
  bei mir \"uber YouTube und Gema auf :) (72 year old reader troubles
  over YouTube and Gema at me :) )} you can find two layers of
sentiments. The first layer is the fact that the reader troubles over
YouTube and Gema. The second layer is the fact that the author of the
tweet is amused about the first fact. So here you have to annotate two
different sentiments. The first is negative and has "YouTube" and
"Gema" as target (with "troubles over" as emo-expression). The second
is positive and has "72 jähriger Leser" as target and "mir" as
source. Do not forget to use the \texttt{sentiment\_ref} attribute to
annotate which sentiment refers to which target.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{source}
\begin{itemize}
\item I can find the same source two times in one tweet. What to do?

Look at this tweet: \texttt{Ich hab \"Ubrigens ne 1 in Englisch.  Find
  ich gut ! (By the way, I got an A- in English. I Like it!)}  Here
the "Ich" in the first sentence needs not to be annotated. It is
sufficient to annotate just the "Ich" in the second sentence. Since
there is no anaphora present you will not need to mark an anaphoric
antecedent as well. \\ Here you should annotate both sentences as one
sentiment with "ne 1- in Englisch" as target, the "I" in the second
sentence as source and "gut" as emo-expression.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{target}

\subsection{emo-expression}
\begin{itemize}
\item What about English emo-expressions?

Although we annotate German tweets, it is not unusual to find English
emo-expressions. For example: \textit{DSDS ist fancy ! (DSDS is fancy
  !)}.  These expressions should be annotated too, if they are common
in German.

\item Should intejections be marked as emo-expressions?

Sollen Interjektionen (oh, aha, achso, OMG etc.) auch als
emo-expressions annotiert werden? Ich habe das n\"amlich nicht
gemacht, weil sie in so gut wie allen F\"allen nicht als wirklich
positiv bzw. negativ zu identifizieren waren. Wie
z.B. \textit{Lichgestaaaaaaaaaaalt !!!!!! in deren Schatten ich mich
  drehe uuuooooooh oooooh uuuuuooohhhh oooooohhhhh xD} oder
\textit{ooh du hasts gut , h\"att auch gern urlaub ...}. Ich finde
Interjektionen auch grenzwertig, da sie unter gewissen Umst\"anden
auch als intensifier dienen k\"onnen, z.B. oh wie gut, oh ja
etc. . Falls sie doch annotiert werden sollen, bitte Bescheid sagen
und/oder eine entsprechende Anmerkung in den Guidelines machen. W\"are
gut explizit zu schreiben ob sie annotiert werden sollen oder nicht.

\item Do we need sarcasm attribute for emo-expressions?

\section{Examples}
Please DO NOT mark as sentiments following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Statements describing some emotional states for which no
  target can be derived or found (e.g. \textit{Ich f\"uhle mich so
    traurig :(} - \textit{I am feeling so blue :(});
\item Statements describing some objective facts, even if possible
  consequences of these facts can be assumed to have negative
  influence on the author (e.g. \textit{Wenn ein Floh einen Menschen
    bei\ss{}t und ihn mit erbrochenem Blut infiziert, werden die
    Pestbakterien ins Gewebe \"ubertragen.} - \textit{When a flea
    bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated
    blood, the plague carrying bacteria are passed into the
    tissue.});
\item Interrogative clauses in case they ask whether some polar
  opinion is true or not. (e.g. \textit{Findet die Mehrheit
    der Bev\"olkerung CDU toll?} - \textit{Does the majority
    of population consider CDU great?});
\end{itemize}

\subsection{negation}
\texttt{negation}s are lexical or syntactic elements that reverse the
primary polar meaning of emo-expressions to the opposite so that the
overall polarity of the whole sentiment is different to the polarity
of emo-expressions belonging to it. A typical example of negation is
\textit{nicht} in sentences like \textit{Ein guter Schritt war diese
  Entscheidung \textbf{nicht}.} (\textit{This decision was
  \textbf{not} a good move.}).

\vspace{0.5cm}
You SHOULD only mark negative elements that have an impact on the
sentiment polarity. Negating elements having no such impact
shold not be marked. Negation elements are usually represented by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Negation particle \textit{nicht} (\textit{not}),
  e.g. \textit{Klug ist dieser Hund sicherlich \textbf{nicht}}
  (\textit{This dog is certainly \textbf{not} clever});

\item Negative article \textit{kein} e.g. \textit{Er war
  \textbf{kein} Vorbild f\"ur seine Kinder} (\textit{He was
  \textbf{not} a good role model for his children});

\item Indefinite pronouns like \textit{niemand}, \textit{keiner}
  etc., e.g. \textit{\textbf{Niemand} hielt ihn f\"ur einen
    ehrlichen Menschen.} (\textit{\textbf{Nobody} considered him an
    honest man});

\item Any lexical or idiomatic unit in case they turn the sentiment
  polarity to the opposite, e.g. \textit{Ich \textbf{zweifle}, dass
    das neue iPhone ein besseres Display hat.} (\textit{I
    \textbf{doubt} the new iPhone has a better display}).
\end{itemize}

DO NOT mark elements as negations that have no effect on the sentiment
polarity. For example, in the sentence \textit{Ich mag Leute, die nicht
  nur an sich selbst denken.} (\textit{I like people who not only care
  about themselves.}) \textit{nicht} (\textit{not}) should \underline{not} be
marked as negation since it does not change the positive polarity
expressed by \textit{m\"ogen} (\textit{like}).
\vspace{0.5cm}

Negations only have one possible attribute, namely
\textit{sentiment-ref} that is a directed edge pointing from a negation
to the sentiment it belongs to. You should only draw this edge in cases multiple sentiment 
relations overlap and it is not obvious to which of these sentiments the negation belongs to,
i.e. in cases the negation is used for both sentiment spans.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{intensifier}
\texttt{intensifier}s are elements that increase the polar
meaning of emotional expressions. Intensifiers are usually expressed
by adjectives or adverbs like \textit{sehr} (\textit{very}),
\textit{ziemlich} (\textit{rather}) and the like. In intensifier-chains 
\textit{(e.g. sehr, sehr gut)} please annotate each intensifier separately.
As mentioned above you should annotate every single emo-expression you can 
find regardless of a corresponding sentiment span. 
Please do not forget to annotate the corresponding intensifier if there is one. \newline

Intensifiers have the following attributes and values: \newline

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{degree} & \textit{1 (default)} & intensifier 
  slightly increases polarity of emotional
  expression, e.g. \textit{ziemlich},
  \textit{recht} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{2} & intensifier strongly increases polarity  of
  emotional expression, e.g. \textit{sehr}, \textit{super},
  \textit{stark} etc.\\\hline

  %%%%%%

  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & Directed
  edge pointing from the intensifier to the sentiment it belongs
  to. By analogy to negations, you should only draw this edge in cases
  multiple sentiment relations overlap and it is not obvious
  to which of these sentiments the intensifier belongs to,
  i.e. in cases when the intensifier is used for both
  sentiment spans.\\\hline
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{diminisher}
\texttt{diminisher}s are the counterpart to \texttt{intensifier}s.
These are elements that decrease the polar meaning of emotional
expressions.  Like intensifiers diminishers are usually expressed by
adjectives or adverbs. Typical examples of such adverbs are
\textit{wenig}, \textit{kaum}, \textit{ein bisschen} etc..

Diminishers have the same attributes as intensifiers. The only
difference are the values for the attribute. Instead of positive
values you have negative ones.

Here is a table of diminisher's attributes:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{\clmnwidth}|}\hline

  \multirow{2}{*}{degree} & \textit{weak (default)} & diminisher
  slightly decreases polarity of emotional expression,
  e.g. \textit{wenig}, \textit{bisschen} etc.\\\cline{2-3}

  & \textit{strong} & diminisher strongly decreases polarity of
  emotional expression, e.g. \textit{kaum} etc.\\\hline


  sentiment-ref & \textit{$->$\newline(directed edge)} & Directed
  edge pointing from the diminisher to the sentiment it belongs
  to. You should only draw this edge in cases
  multiple sentiment relations overlap and it is not obvious
  to which of these sentiments the diminisher belongs to,
  i.e. in cases when the diminisher is used for both
  sentiment spans.\\\hline

\end{tabular}

\section{MMAX Techniques}
In this section the most important techniques for annotating our corpus in MMAX will be described.

\subsection{Turn on Auto-Save and Auto-apply}
After setting up MMAX load a .mmax file as described in the beginning
of this document. You will be asked to validate the
annotations. Please always do that.  Before you start the annotation
it is recommended to turn on "Auto-Save" and "Auto-apply". Go to
\texttt{File -> Auto-Save -> Every} and select a time value.  Then
change to the window for the attributes (the window in the upper left
corner of your screen) and go to \texttt{Settings} and check the
\texttt{Auto-apply} box.  Your choice will be confirmed by a red
"Auto-apply is ON" at the bottom of the window. \newline

\subsection{Annotate Markables and Attributes}
The window in the middle of your screen now should show the tweets. To annotate a markable choose a word, phrase, clause or sentence by clicking the left mouse-button and mark the respective span while holding the mouse-button. After releasing the left mouse-button a menu will pop up showing the list of markables. Left-click on the corresponding markable and the span will turn to the respective color of the markable. Then change to the attribute window in the upper left corner, click on the tab for the markable you just annotated and set the value(s) for the attributes. (In case you did not turn on "Auto-apply" press "Apply".)

\subsection{Deleting Markables}
Just do a \underline{right-click} on a colored markable and left-click \texttt{Delete this markable}.

\subsection{Annoating Discontinuous Markables}
Sometimes you will find discontinuous emo-expressions. The most prominent example are German particle verbs (e.g. weh tun). To annotate them as one single element first annotate one element (it will turn to the respective markable color) as usual, left-click to highlight it and then mark the other element. A menu will pop up saying "Add to this markable". Left-click on that.

\subsection{Annotating anaphref}
Imaginge you have a sentence like: \textit{Peter ist schlau und gut aussehen tut er auch noch. (Peter is clever and he looks good, too.)}. Here you should annotate \textit{er} as anaphref to \textit{Peter}. To do so first annotate \textit{Peter} and \textit{er} as single targets. Then left-click on \textit{Peter} to highlight the markable and then do a \underline{right-click} on \textit{er}. A menu will pop up saying \texttt{"Mark as anaphric antecendent of target"}. Left-click on that.

\subsection{Annotating sentiment\_ref}
The same technique as above applies. First mark a sentiment span as usual. Second annotate the other markable (whatever it may be) as usual. Left-click on the first markable to highlight it then \underline{right-click} on the second markable and in the pop-up menu left-click on "Mark sentiment which this span belongs to".

\section{FAQ}

\underline{Things you SHOULD mark as sentiments:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Phrases, clauses, sentences and statements expressing a polar opinion
    (e.g. \textit{Der neue Film \"uber Superman war knorke!} -
    \textit{The new superman movie was fantastic});
  \item Interrogative clauses containing a polar opinion
    and do not call this opinion into question but rather ask for its
    reasons or other related aspects (e.g. \textit{Warum findet die
      Mehrheit der Bev\"olkerung CDU so toll?} - \textit{Why does the
      majority of the population consider CDU great?});
  \item Exclamations expressing support or disapproval of
    something (e.g. \textit{Der Sommer ist da. Super!} -
    \textit{Summer has come. Great!}).
  \item Comparisons expressing some preference of one subject/object over another 
      (e.g. \textit{Canon EOS 550d macht bessere Aufnahmen als 600d} - \textit{Canon EOS 550d takes
      better pictures than 600d}).
\end{itemize}


\underline{Things you SHOULD NOT mark as sentiments:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statements that do not have an annotatable target:
      (e.g. \textit{F\"uhle mich so traurig :(} - \textit{Feeling so blue :(});
  \item Statements describing some objective facts, even if possible
    consequences of these facts can be assumed to have negative
    influence on the author (e.g. \textit{Wenn ein Floh einen Menschen
      bei\ss{}t und ihn mit erbrochenem Blut infiziert, werden die
      Pestbakterien ins Gewebe \"ubertragen.} - \textit{When a flea
      bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated
      blood, the plague carrying bacteria are passed into the
      tissue.});
  \item Interrogative clauses in case they ask whether some polar
    opinion is true or not. (e.g. \textit{Findet die Mehrheit
      der Bev\"olkerung CDU toll?} - \textit{Does the majority
      of the population consider CDU great?});
\end{itemize}

\underline{Things you SHOULD mark as sources:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Original author(s) of polar opinions, i.e. persons,
    groups or officials who express sympathy or antipathy for
    something or somebody e.g. \textit{\textbf{Michael} meinte, das w\"are die
      beste L\"osung.}  (\textit{\textbf{Michael} thought, it would be the
      best solution.});
\end{itemize}


\underline{Things you SHOULD NOT mark as sources:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Persons how are neutrally citing someone else's opinion,
    e.g. in the sentence \textit{Nach Tatjanas Worten war Michael sehr
      dar\"uber ver\"argert.} (\textit{According to Tatjana, Michael
      was very angry about that.}) you should only mark
    \textit{Michael} as source and not \textit{Tatjana}. Please note, that in case an author
    supports or contradicts someone else's opinion, two sentiment
    relations should be made - one with the original author as source
    and one with the supporter/opponent of the opinion as the other
    source.\footnote{In that case sentiments will overlap, and
      you also should mark these sources with \textit{sentiment-ref}-tag.}
\end{itemize}

\underline{Things you SHOULD mark as emo-expressions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Adjectives and adverbs bearing polar attitudes \textit{Peter
    hatte \textbf{bessere} Noten in der Schule als sein Bruder}
    (\textit{Peter had \textbf{better} grades at school than his
    brother.});

  \item Verbs expressing attitude of a speaker to target,
    e.g. \textit{Mir \textbf{gefiel} die neue House-Staffel}
    (\textit{I \textbf{liked} the new House series});

  \item Idiomatic expression including support verbs
    e.g. \textit{\textbf{Zum Teufel} soll die neue Regierung
      \textbf{gehen}} (\textit{The new government should \textbf{go to
        hell}}).

  \item Smileys in case they really express an emotional attitude and
    are not used for politeness or without any particular meaning
    e.g. \textit{Gleich in Braunschweig mit Kameraden treffen
        \textbf{:)}} (\textit{Will soon meet friends in Braunschweig
        \textbf{:)}}).
\end{itemize}
